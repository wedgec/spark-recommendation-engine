**Description**: Our task was to implement in Spark an item-based recommendation engine given a dataset of Amazon reviews. Given a single product, our engine was to recommend ten similar products. We isolated tuples of userID, productID, and rating, and then used Spark's library for matrix factorization. For a more complete description and discussion of our implementation, please refer to our report PDF. See also the assignment instructions.
