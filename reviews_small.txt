review/summary: Periwinkle Dartmouth Blazer
review/text: I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it-- it is a staple of my business wardrobe. Well made, quality fabric, nicely tailored, classic lines, appropriate for a professional woman. (something that can be hard to find at times) It should be noted, however, that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely, but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the "classic" colors(lighter) and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown, navy, camel, red and ivory. It's still a good value, particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates, but I was a bit surprised.

review/summary: Nice collection of Julie Strain images
review/text: This is only for Julie Strain fans. It's a collection of her photos -- about 80 pages worth with a nice section of paintings by Olivia.If you're looking for heavy literary content, this isn't the place to find it -- there's only about 2 pages with text and everything else is photos.Bottom line: if you only want one book, the Six Foot One ... is probably a better choice, however, if you like Julie like I like Julie, you won't go wrong on this one either.

review/summary: First album I've bought since Napster
review/text: We've come a long way since the days of Ninetendo synthesized music! I say without exaggeration that the Chrono Cross Original Soundtrack is probably some of the best instrumental music I've ever heard. Yasunori Mitsuda incorporates so many instruments and musical styles to this collection, it's a real credit to his talent. Guitars, violins, cellos and the piano are just a few of the instruments at play here. Although they differ greatly in musical style, I have to draw an analogy between Mitsuda's music here to the songs of the Grateful Dead: on this album there is a song for every mood.I would recommend this album to those who enjoyed playing the Chrono Trigger/Chrono Cross series, as well as those who are Final Fantasy fans. I stumbled across this music while downloading other video game music off the Internet, and I don't regret spending the money on this album at all. A great deal of care has been given to this music and it really shows in the end product. Anyone who enjoys good music will find it here.Maybe the best tribute to a musician isn't critical acclaim, but emulation by the fans. I've come across sheet music, remixes and covers of Mitsuda's work on this album, all done by fans as tribute and the desire to perform such music for themselves. This album is good stuff. Frankly I hope Mitsuda makes more.

review/summary: Pleasant to the ear, musical masterpiece
review/text: Final fantasy fans may be at first skeptical of Chrono Cross's composition and production under unknown Yasunori Mitsuda, but never fear, Uematsu serves a minor role as Executive Producer! Mistuda knew what music hit home in this Celtic-themed OST. Believe me, I was skeptical as a Final Fantasy fan, until I played the game and couldn't help sitting there listening to the music!The collection is a 3-CD masterpiece. The CD's are in tracks that are appropriately given up in chronological order, and you can picture playing through the game in your mind. What's awesome is the range of new instruments and styles in the sequel to the RPG of all RPGs. MIDI sequences can't show what the original version does in this OST. Rated a 10 by EGM for best music waaaay back in the day, it's not unfounded.Okay, so the insert is in japanese - keep in mind you can't find this thing in the states anymore. DigiCube's downfall makes it hard enough to find this thing, so grab it while you can. You can get translations in a variety of places that no longer have the CDs in stock (there are a few, believe me). If you loved the game, this is a required. If you are a video game music fan, consider it as essential as the FF7 OST and remember the name Yasunori Mitsuda.Things to keep an eye out for - Disc 1, Track 7 displays a theme that you hear throughout the game, and it sounds great to hear it again. All of Disc 3 is pure musical rewards, and Track 7 on it is... well, to avoid spoling too much... it's worth the $32 plus shipping. Oh, and for all the big press Radical Dreamers and Magical Dreamers get, it's worth it even if you haven't played the games all the way through - there aren't any spoilers to ruin the experience. Just pure, amazing rpg music worthy of the title of the game.I ordered this right before going on a Choir Concert Tour Ireland, and the Celtic themes helped me enjoy the experience to the fullest!Oh, if you're considering playing the game, do what I DID NOT DO, and what others hope to do - Play Chrono Trigger First, then Chrono Cross, if you can.

review/summary: Much more than a game Soundtrack.
review/text: This has got to be one of the best video game soundtracks ever. I've actually never really played the game, but somehow discovered the music of it, proving you don't have to like the game to like the soundtrack. I'm sure the game is also great, and maybe someday I'll purchase a PS2 and play it.The way the few different main themes are repeated throughout the discs makes it so much more epic and adventurous. The same notes, played at a different speed and with different instruments can have such different moods, and are certainly not repetitive.Many songs consist of synthesized violins, guitars, Japanese instruments and other stringed instruments, also pianos, interesting percussion, and many other synthesized sounds. The songs are made up of clear, well-produced melodious tones and notes. There are so many different moods on this cd... nostalgic, melancholic, joyful, tense, epic, pensive, spooky, calm, wondrous, ethereal, delightful, catchy... the list goes on. Of course, the music styles range from Celtic sounding, to traditional Japanese, to neoclassical, etc. all blended together nicely with Yasunori Mitsuda's special touch. A lot of the songs really make me think &quot;epic&quot; in one way or another. Many songs are also edgy or stressful like the music for a battle or difficult journey, but sometimes with a childlike tinge, suggesting the fantasy/anime aspect of the game (I'm not saying anime is childish, rather the music sounds that way at times, in a good way) Some songs have soaring melodies that revive the valiant atmosphere of the soundtrack, others have quite gloomy moods, some have simple, charming melodies, some have more spooky or haunting moods, some sound sort of like a big fairground or joyful gathering, and some have more of a feeling of a specific area like a maritime or tropical place - illustrating all the elements of a long, adventurous, tiring journey of many different perils, mysteries, and missions of all sizes.Obviously there are a lot of separate tracks on this soundtrack to encompass every single moment of music in the game (Why would you want to leave anything out?) but even the songs less than a minute are quite good. I'm not going to point out specific tracks because I'd end up listing about one-third of them, nor will I describe many specific tracks; every song is worth listening to, from start to finish. The most talked about song &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; is a nice song with female vocals in Japanese that follows the main theme of the album, and I can see why most people consider it the best song on here, particularly the last minute or so with the angelic-like hum and amazing, gentle acoustic guitar melodies. The immaculate music box style melody after Radical Dreamers concludes the album with a very memorable sensation.I mentioned in my list of adjectives &quot;nostalgic&quot;: of course it will feel truly nostalgic if you've played the game a few years ago and didn't think about buying the soundtrack until now, reminiscing parts of the game you struggled at and enjoyed while you listen. But if you didn't have the game, it might trigger memories about other games or certain times in childhood... even though this game isn't very old at all. That may sound really weird, but it happens to me a little... I remember having fun with many SNES games since I didn't play through this.This album is sincerely worth the import price, not only is it a triple album with 67 tracks lasting over 3 hours, but is by far the most inspiring game soundtrack I've heard so far and can be enjoyed by people with the most diverse tastes. After listening to this for the first few times, it seems superior to everything else in your music collection.

review/summary: If you want RPG music, this is for you.
review/text: I'm not an expert on Mitsuda's work but I was by no means disappointed by Chrono Cross and the soundtrack it created.Beginning with TIME'S SCAR. Here we have a Celtic dance tune emerging from a quiet beginning whisper. I will admit I love the BRINK OF DEATH although not everyone may agree. The remainder of the first album is like a tour through the music of the first few hours of the game. You'll notice that Arni has two themes for the two worlds, as do many other localities in the game.All along, the tunes are kept simple and in line with the various locations of the game. Rarely do the storyline and music disagree. DREAM OF THE SHORE catches the dark, lonely feeling Serge must have had stranded in the lost world (would have worked better here if it had been autumn in Another World). Other favorites from the first disk are SINGING EMOTIONS, ANOTHER TERMINA which adds a touch of Renaissance style to a Renaissance-style city.Death Volcano is one of the most come-out-of-nowhere themes, as is Child of Time. Beginning from a stir, they grow to match the environment they exist in. The two Guldove themes provide a good example of the contrast between the energetic and vernal Home World and the laid-back, autumnal Another World.The second disc is where it really shines. I won't go through all the examples but will say that Another Marbule and the Magical Dreamers theme are uplifting and excellent. Classical/rock combinations rarely fail.The third disc is haunting, spiritual, romantic, and all. Indeed it is where all the powerful emotions come together in a complex but orderly amalgam. GARDEN OF THE GODS is unforgettable with its choral chant and delicate minor key; the Chronopolis theme shines with futurism and even a touch of scientific socialism. The Fate, Jellyfish, and Orphanage themes stand apart, notably the Jellyfish Sea which really sounds appropriate for an underwater world. It is ambient and environmental.You won't forget the GIRL WHO STOLE THE STARS or TIME OF THE DREAMWATCH, as these are, respectively, the love theme (between Serge and Kid) and the "liberty" overture played in the second intro. After two last super-duper tracks (TOWER OF STARS and DRAGON GOD) we get to the closing music. I found UNSTOLEN JEWEL (Radical Dreamers' LE TRESOR INTERDIT)to be too soft for full effect; the game theme that precedes it is much better. (You have to use the Chrono Cross item to hear it in the game). UNSTOLEN JEWEL reminds me of "My Heart Will Go On" and the main theme from Lord of the Rings in that it is a vocal version of a melody already heard via instruments.Still, by the time this soundtrack is over, you may be either shedding tears or wanting to get the game if you haven't already.

review/summary: An amazing OST!! Perfect in every way!
review/text: I played Chrono Cross a year ago. It was and still is my favorite video game of all time, not because of the thought provoking story, not the memorable cast, what left me crying after a sad scene, or jumping for joy after a stunning victory, was the amazing aural sounds composed by Mitsuda. This man is a genious, combining amazing genres of music into a compilation of tracks that will please any person, even if they don't enjoy instrumental music. Words cannot express some of the emotions the music convey's. Perhaps I love it so much because it is a reminder, a wonderful reminiscent that makes my mind soar whenever I remember where I heard a track in the game, and how the music helped that portion of the game impact my emotions. After listening to this CD, I am certain that the music is the single most important part of any video game, because without it, there is nothing except a group of people talking in silent text, with nothing in the background to make the scene intriguing and/or emotionally impacting. I urge all music fans to buy this CD. For the wonderful music you will have the privelage to listen to, no price can be put. This is truly a priceless experience.

review/text: Attn: Do not purchase from Art_of_Music, copies from this store are bootleg and had terrible sound quality. The soundtrack was released by Miya records, a well known bootlegger, for their poor quality. Seller responded to all my emails until he received the return. I sent several emails to the seller, but never heard from him. I ended up having to go through Amazon's claims to get my refund.Music made me play the game again. I had played Chrono Trigger so many times, but only played Chrono Cross once. The music was so fun to listen to while playing, so I'm going to re-order the soundtrack from Amazon and wait however long it takes for it to ship.I just found out that Chrono Cross is getting released on the Playstation Network. Should be good.

review/text: As a frequent player of RPG's I have listened to many RPG soundtracks, not counting that I've beaten many. But, I must say that in comparison to the Final Fantasy Series (I own 7, 8, 9, and 10 and have played all of them) Chrono Cross easily wins in gameplay and its music. The music seems to perfectly go along with the plot. It is moving and inspiring to keep playing, which is helpful 'cause it took me like 8 hours to figure-out how to get that hydra stuff for Kid and the music continued to reassure me to keep playing.So, you can understand how I feel about this soundtrack, and if you're gonna buy the soundtrack and you don't have the game, which would be awkward, buy the game! Have fun! RPG on!

I played it again after some time, Then i figured it. The music. The game opens with the only fully orchestrated peice, still by the composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Mitsuda synthesizes the rest, nothing of his music is second rate. I couldn't believe a single person sat behind a synthesizer, perhaps with countless samples at his disposal, and created this wonderful accompanyment to the game. When I bought this soundtrack, This very one, it cost me a wopping 50 bucks. I enjoyed the purchase and didn't whine about it because of the quality jump from when listening while playing the game. When you listen to the soundtrack with the game fresh on your mind, you notice all the instuments and sounds that we're left out, or unable to be broadcasted. The very details that made this piece more than a soundtrack. It stands alone as the greatest game soundtrack ever.

review/summary: Yasunori Mitsuda's soothing, classical masterwork.
review/text: While not associated with the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, Yasunori Mitsuda has still become a legend for his musical works on Square titles. His legendary works include the soundtracks to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and &quot;Xenogears&quot;, and joining that prestigious list is the &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; soundtrack. Spanning three discs worth of music, the soundtrack to &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; is a soothing, classical masterwork.The first thing that listeners will notice about the &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; soundtrack is that the music is very mild compared to, say, the music of &quot;Xenogears&quot;. That's not saying that there aren't any fast-paced tracks on this soundtrack, but overall the music doesn't demand a powerful emotional response using heavy instrumentation and bass. Instead, the soundtrack uses soothing, gentle melodies to envoke an emotional response, and even during fast-paced songs the feeling of calmness remains. Each song is a work of art, and while some songs are more memorable than others, they all play their part to paint a tapestry of unforgettable sound.One of the soundtrack's greatest accomplishments is the way it sounds. Mitsuda's previous masterpieces always gave the modest impression that, despite the excellence of the melodies, the songs were played using synth-like instruments. The &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; soundtrack rarely, if ever, does that. Although some instrumentation obviously sounds synth-like, the listener can somehow believe that the songs sound orchestrated. Mitsuda's demonstrated his talent for putting quality, life-like music in the &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; game when it was released on the PSX, and that quality has carried over to this marvelous soundtrack.If there is one flaw with the soundtrack, it's that is might be TOO gentle. Some people might be put off by the idea of listening to roughly three hours of gentle music with just a few fast tracks to speed things up. Even the soundtrack's vocal song, &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot;, is slow-paced, and while some people may like it, others may feel the lack of multiple instrumentation (the song uses only an acoustic guitar) actually ruins it. However, if you take the time to listen to the soundtrack, it will grow on you.All in all, the &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; soundtrack is another one of Yasunori Mitsuda's masterpieces. While it may take a couple of tries to get used to the overall gentleness of the music, once it grows on you, you won't be able to stop listening to it. Along with &quot;Xenogears&quot;, &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; is an absolute must-have soundtrack.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of "Prisoners of Fate" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in "A Distant Promise" and "Girl who Stole the Star" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like "Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~", "Time of the Dreamwatch", and "Chronomantique" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.

review/summary: Some of the best gaming music around.
review/text: Yasunori Mitsuda is one of the best composers for video game music in my opinion. Chrono Cross is a sequal to the popular game, Chrono Trigger. Both soundtracks are composed by this person. Most of the songs on this soundtrack are unlike other soundtracks because these take a form of being more "new age" on a number of the tracks (Time's Scar for example), whereas others more guitar classical (Radical Dreamers, Another Gardopu). The diversity of these songs, and the little overlap (using the same theme over and over again - Although the theme from Magical Dreamers is used in 3-4 tracks).I highly recommend this soundtrack, especially if you played the game or like more classical/newage types of music. Out of all the gaming soundtracks I own (This is probably well over 20 or so) this soundtrack definitely is the top one I enjoy a lot. The themes on most of the songs are great, and there's enough musical diveristy to keep the songs interesting even through multiple times of listening.

review/summary: Mitsuda's Masterpiece
review/text: While Yasunori Mitsuda's score for Chrono Trigger was nicely done and well-composed, it's hard not to notice that it sounds just like what it is: video game music. The game's sequel, on the other hand, while having the same great musical authorship, also sounds much more organic, which is probably why I like the Chrono Cross soundtrack just a little more than its predecessor.Right at the beginning of the first disc "Time's Scar" starts off with a sense of serenity and then grabs your attention by turning into what sounds like a musical stampede. While this is a standout track, many of the pieces just get better from there. The somewhat Carribianesque "Plains of Time" commences with an amazing guitar hook and then proceeds to play the main theme found throughout Chrono Trigger (a very catchy melody which I've always liked). "Dream of the Shore Near Another Ocean" tones things down a bit with its poignant, mournful strings and soft, resplendent keyboard melody playing in the background. Other highlights from disc one include "Aruni Village", "Singing Emotions", "Triumph" (short but sweet), and "Another Galdove."Disc two, being my least favorite of the three, nevertheless has some standout pieces that are not to be missed. "Voyage~Home World" is so amazingly catchy that I simply wore it out after hearing it for the first time. "Chronomantique" is another version of the tune found in "Plains of Time" and "People Imprisoned By Destiny" is arguably the saddest and most moving song in the entire Game Music Genre.Disc three picks things up again and has some of my favorite pieces on the soundtrack. "Garden of God" is just awesome. It has a very New Age-type feel to it. Follow this up with other tracks like "Star-Stealing Girl" and "Dreamwatch Of Time" and you're probably thinking that things just can't get much better. But, just like any good composer, Mitsuda saves the best for last. While many of the reviewers here have highlighted "Radical Dreamers" as a stand-out vocal piece, I'm actually more partial to "Life~Far Away Promise." There's just something about that mourning woodwind that "sings" the chorus (if you will) that just gets to me. Also, as far as video game music goes, I've always preferred instrumental music to vocal tracks. With that being said, both of the songs do an excellent rendition of the main themes found in this soundtrack and I'm sure that most of Mitsuda's fans will enjoy both of them.There's really nothing else I can say that others haven't said already. I would recommend this soundtrack whether or not you're into game music, especially if you're into instrumental music of any kind. Yasunori just plays with so many styles and he does all of them beautifully. Virtually everyone will be able to find something of value in this three disc collection and, as others have mentioned,it is both a masterpiece and a classic.

review/summary: One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play
review/text: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.

review/text: once again, i'm amazed. I was playing the actual game (not the soundtrack) the other day and i thought in my mind that one of the reasons i always played that game, even though i beat it at least 2 or 3 times is because of the amazing music. so i got the soundtrack. Seriously, its amazing the music he has created with a new wide range of instruments (compared to MIDI only in his still awesome soundtrack, Chrono Trigger). this soundtrack will satisfy your mood no matter what mood you're in. from sad music to happy music to exciting music to calm music this soundtrack has pretty much everything you could want in a game soundtrack. Get this soundtrack if your a fan of Music of any type!!!

review/text: I have many video game soundtracks, as well as anime soundtracks, and I must say that this could top them all. If I could listen to one cd before I die, this might well be it. If you haven't played the game, it really doesn't matter. The compositions should appeal to anyone who loves relaxing yet often upbeat sounds brilliantly put together. I'd definitly recommend it. While you're buying this, I'd also recommend playing the game as well (if you haven't already).

review/summary: Best Video Game Score Ever
review/text: Mitsuda is a musical genius. All the parts he writes seem to fall into place perfectly. I grew up loving music by John Williams and Hans Zimmer and this guy is right up there with them. For some songs his style turns away from the traditonal orchestra and still has the same impact. One of the best parts is only a few songs seem ambient while the others are just amazing. My favorites are, Lost Pieces, Garden of God, On the Banks of a Dream, and possibly the one of the saddest themes I've ever heard is People Seized With Life. First time listeners would probably think this music was from some epic movie when in fact it's the music to an epic game. The Chrono series has two of the best rpg's ever and by far the best composer writing for them.

review/summary: Enchanting Musical Genius
review/text: If there is a music album which almost reaches absoulete perfection this must be it. Every human emotion is mirrored through this unbeleivable three disc set which takes you on a roller coaster ride through the fascinating world of chrono cross.It starts with the soulful enchanting but powerful 'Scars of Time' which seamlesly fuses fast paced mayhem with soul stirring emotions and ends with one of the greatest musical accomplishments of any genre during any time the magnificent &quot;Radical Dreamers Unstolen Jewel&quot;. One word to decribe this song would be enchantment. It transports you to another world a world without sorrow or memory and is everything it should be. The song alone is worth the price of this CD.Amid these two masterpieces are more beautiful gems strewn across this three disc marvel. Magical dreamers is music with true feeling to back it up and another world displays superbly the magic of the acoustic guitar. Even the atmoshperic music is top notch with subtle changes in flavour here and there which entice and charm you.The tunes vary from those depicting bravery and sacrifice like 'Dragon Rider' to those depicting strife and internal grief like 'People imprisoned by destiny'.The wide spectrum of instruments and musical genres is also excellent as it keeps your attention span for the entire three discs.I think this is how music was meant to be. Every note in this album is emotionally charged and there are very few things to forget in this album. If you are looking for good music then chono cross will gve you something which you will never forget and something you will treasure for the rest of your life. I think Yasunori Mitsuda will soon become the premier composer of our time.

review/summary: WOW.
review/text: Yasunori Mitsuda pushed the PlayStation to the limits with one of the most lush soundtracks to ever grace a game. Perfectly keyed to its settings, the music drips with the feeling of tropical islands and exotic locales before dipping into the darker requiems near the end.It's hard to believe this is synthesizer work, as it's some of the clearest and most rich sound to come out of a game. It fits the atmosphere and settings perfectly. It's especially powerful once you've played through the game, as the emotional impact of certain scenes (like the fight against Miguel in the Tower of Geddon) is enhanced beyond words by tracks like &quot;People Imprisoned by Destiny&quot; (disc 2, track 16). Other music - like &quot;Voyage - Home World&quot; (disc 2, track 05) and &quot;Dancing Lizards&quot; (disc 1, track 05) are just perfect for opening the window and feeling good. Mitsuda's skillful mix of dark, operatic, and brooding tunes with bouncy, bright tropicalia makes for an excellent album.This is one of a few game music soundtracks I would fully recommend to everyone, even those who aren't into the genre - or don't play games. It's amazing and should not be missed. And, of course, if you ARE a fan of game music, and don't own this... I'm amazed. Buy it as soon as possible, it is not a regrettable decision.

I'm not gonna name my personal favorites, because...well...that's something you should decide for yourself. So...get this! And decide!

But when I put Chrono Cross into my Playstation for the first time I was blown away by the opening FMV with the score &quot;Time's Scar&quot;. After that I payed real close attention to the music throughout the entire game. I was simply impressed with how the music swept me right into the game. It put me in a different state of mind. Relieved all my stress and let me relax. It scared me when it brought a tear to my eye. Never would I have thought that video game music would do this to me. And no, Im not exaggerating. And I highly reccomend this incredible soundtrack and the rest of Mitsuda's work (Chrono Trigger, Xenogears)to anyone with a taste for beautiful music!

review/summary: Truly a timeless masterpiece...
review/text: For many RPG fans, Chrono Trigger (for the SNES) was considered to be one of the best RPGs ever made. Squaresoft didn't disappoint loyal fans when they unexpectedly came out with Chrono Cross for the PlayStation. Along with Final Fantasy X and Chrono Trigger, I would have to these three games to be the best RPGs of all time.Since I myself am a music buff, I usually rate games and music based on the soundtrack and character development, rather than the actual gameplay and battle system. I won't go into other aspects of the game (see the Chrono Cross PlayStation reviews), but Chrono Cross, lives up to its reputation in all the categories.The music brings in themes from Chrono Trigger (e.g. Track 04 contains music from its predecessor), plus introduces brand new themes with lots of different influences (e.g. the Celtic quality of the introduction theme). Overall, the music is one of the best I've heard for anything (including games and movies), well-deserving a 10 out of 10.

The music was apart of the game, and definatly sets the player into the right frame of mind when playing.I've always found game music to be excellent, but Yasunori Mitsuda stands out in my mind, just as Nobou Uematsu (composer of the Final Fantasy series) does.Each song sounds animated, realistic, and unique. Some of the best songs on the album (in my opinion) are Time's Scar, Another Termina, Lost Child of Time and the Brink of Death. Though I love nearly every song that I remember in the game.This soundtrack is highly recommended!

review/text: I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^

review/summary: Masterpiece from a Virtuoso Composer
review/text: Yasunori Mitsuda must be one of the greatest musical virtuosos of our time, and Chrono Cross is his most impressive achievement to date. This Japanese composer - who also wrote the music for Chrono Trigger, Xenogears, and Xenosaga - is a master at using several styles of music to define his unique work: celtic, arabian, classical, neoclassical, and traditional japanese influences are all recognizable and expertly crafted into this work. Rather than limit himself to a narrow selection of instruments and styles, Mitsuda combines these traditional styles and adds his own exciting flavor to the mix. The mixture will capture your ear starting at the beginning.Almost all the tracks will be familiar to those who have played Chrono Cross (an excellent game), and many are reminiscent of the Chrono Trigger soundtrack. These recognizable themes are like mom's apple pie to gamers: they should remind you of long, enjoyable hours and memorable moments from your gameplay experience. Divorced from the video game, the music may not have the nostalgic effects, but it stands alone as a powerhouse of composing talent and a monumental achievement in modern music.The Chrono Cross OST is divided into 3 discs entitled Cause, Unveiling, and Change: each building on the theme of temporal change and disturbance. The best way to listen to this album is from start to finish without interruption; this is the only way you can truly appreciate how the music develops. All the tracks together last slightly longer than three hours, but it will be well worth your investment of time and money. Listening to Mitsuda's work stimulates the imagination and keeps the mind involved, whether it be through exciting, active tracks or ambient, meditative ones.Most of the songs are calm and relaxing, as they are intended to double as background music, but many are sure to get your blood pumping. Some of the best tracks are Time's Grasslands, Dream on a Shore Bordering Another World, Chronomantic, Predicament, Radical Dreamers, and one vocal track, sung in Japanese, that is a beautiful complement to the instrumental work. Certainly do not listen exclusively to these tracks, though, because you would miss the musical experience. After you finish the soundtrack, you will want to start it over and listen again.Mitsuda takes synthetic and game music to a new level. He is the most innovative composer currently working today, and this soundtrack is a collection of some of his most impressive and inspiring work. The Chrono Cross OST is a must have for music and game lovers alike.

review/summary: Chrono Cross: Mitsuda's crowning achievement.
review/text: For those of you who have played the game, you are all too familiar with the various themes throughout the soundtrack. From the moving and dramatic opening song, &quot;Time's Scar,&quot; the upbeat and fun &quot;Dancing the Tokage,&quot; and the eerie vocal track &quot;Radical Dreamers,&quot; this soundtrack satiates those of us with diverse tastes in music.However, for those of you who can't equate love of the soundtrack with love of the game (heaven forbid), then here is some information that you will probably value. Some of the tracks border on celtic themes, while others are of the more traditional classical style of music. There is one vocal song (as mentioned previously) that is absolutely beautiful, even if it is sung in Japanese. Although the music is synthesized, the sounds are so crisp that, for the most part (especially with the opening), you can't tell that the piece is not being performed by real instruments. The synthesized music goes so far as to include &quot;accidentals,&quot; such as the sound of fingers travelling down the guitar strings, which adds to a more realistic sound.I highly reccommend this soundtrack (3CDs) for anyone who enjoys listening to excellent, well written music. Mitsuda's talent is well displayed in this soundtrack (he also wrote the music to Chrono Trigger and Xenogears). If you are leery about jumping into a purchase before sampling some mp3's (don't worry, I'm the same way), then I suggest listening to the three songs I listed in the first paragraph. They are a good representation of the whole, although there are MANY other tracks that are excellent as well.

review/summary: Best game soundtrack in my collection
review/text: Basic info: Music composed arranged and produced by Yasunori Mitsuda. 3-disc set. Disc 1: 69:40 (29 tracks). Disc 2: 59:50 (26 tracks). Disc 3: 53:21 (16 tracks). Most packaging is in Japanese, but you can get the English track list by playing the CD in an internet-connected computer with a CDDB-compatible audio player, like Apple's &quot;iTunes&quot;.I'd heard this was a wonderful soundtrack and bought it at an anime convention before I'd even played the game. If only all my impulse purchases went so well. I knew Mitsuda's style from the &quot;Xenogears&quot; soundtrack, but &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; blew me away.Whereas so many PlayStation game soundtracks are dominated by marches (Brave Fencer Musashiden), or synthesized brass and ominous church-bells (Final Fantasy), Chrono Cross' music offers string quartets, acoustic guitar, bouzouki and a decidedly Celtic feel, with the horns and drums only coming out for the occasional battle theme or Dramatic Moment. Not only does the music fit the exploratory and communicative tasks that it commonly underscores in the game, but it also holds up better for casual listening. This, potentially, is game music for people who don't know or don't like game music. Disc 1 in particular alternates betweens moods of gentleness and uneasy mystery.Disc 3's &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot;, sung by Noriko Mitose, upholds Squaresoft's recent tradition of an end-of-game pop song that is presaged by earlier tracks in the score, and fits in nicely as a closer to the soundtrack, though it probably doesn't stand out enough to show up on internet anime radio stations like Final Fantasy VIII's &quot;Eyes On Me&quot; does.A 3-disc import doesn't come cheap, but if you are at all interested in Chrono Cross and its music, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this soundtrack.

review/summary: Good, and not just for game music
review/text: "I've never played the game, but I've watched it." How many times have you heard that phrase? That was the case for me and Chrono Cross and as a result I had the pleasure of concentrating more on the story and, best of all, the music. Yasunori Mitsuda has a knack for setting the emotional tone of a scene with his music: even on older games such as Chrono Trigger, he demonstrated that video game music can be more than just a repetitive or monotonous theme; rather it can be an entire score. In this case, three CDs worth of a score.Mitsuda and other Japanese composers do something incredibly ambitious with scores like these: writing enough music to fill games that gamers may spend 50 or more hours playing. Yes, even this music can get monotonous at times (RPG gamers will know what I mean by "battle music"), but thankfully, you don't have to listen to the music in that fashion with this soundtrack.My favorite tracks are, of course, the couple that incorporate actual acoustic instruments. The synthesized tracks, however, are still some of the best that I've heard from a video game score. More specifically, the guitar tracks are impressive. The instrumentalists went to the trouble of adding subtle touches like the noise of fingers sliding over steel or nylon strings which is convincing enough at times to make you do an aural double-take.The style is varied, but you can liken it to a bit Celtic, a bit Renaissance, and a bit modern. What really matters is that it sounds good and it's fun to listen to.It's difficult for me to give this or any other game soundtrack five stars when compared to other music selections. I'll just say my 5 star rating is within the context of video game scores - you'll be hard pressed to find a better one. In the context of all music, however, I'd give this a 4 or 4.5, not because of the composer but because of the limitations of the genre. This music needs to be looped and it needs to fit in a small amount of computer memory and as a result will suffer compared to a full orchestral score for an opera or movie. The music still stands on its own and I have no problems recommending this to music lovers in general.

review/summary: Yasunori Mitsuda creates another masterpiece
review/text: Once again, the composer of Chrono Trigger and Xenogears has composed a soundtrack of consistently high quality. I can't wait to see what Yasunori Mitsuda's next project, Tsugunai for the PlayStation 2, will give us.The Chrono Cross Soundtrack, while it has its share of warlike battle anthems to get your heart pounding, seems to focus on calming, Celtic-influenced songs, with lots of guitars and flutes. A nice bonus: since the game takes place in two parallel worlds, most themes have two or more versions, arranged using different tempo and instruments.This 3-CD set includes all the music from Chrono Cross. Although it's all good, highlights include: on disc 1, Scars of Time, both versions of Arni Village, and Memory - Lingering Feelings; on disc 2, Dragon Knight; and on disc 3, Time of the Dreamwatch, Life - The Faraway Promise, and The Jewel Not Stolen (sung by Noriko Mitose).The liner notes include interesting commentary about each and every single track by Mitsuda. However, remember that this is a Japanese soundtrack, and so the liner notes are in Japanese. However, there are translations of them as well as of the track list floating around if, like most Americans, you don't know Japanese.Definitely a good purchase. Well worth the price!

review/summary: Absolutely Awesome!!!
review/text: This soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard. It contains all of the songs heard in the game. They are mostly played in chronological order. This music is all orchestral and follows a caribbian theme, since the game is based around a group of islands. Most of the songs and the booklet it comes with are all in Japanese. The only things that are in English are a few of the really important song titles. This music is well worth getting even though the price may be a little high. But think about it you are getting 67 songs spread over 3 CD's. Anyway I would highly suggest this music to any Chrono Cross Game fanatic, or if you enjoy orchestral music.Hope this review helps.

review/summary: A soundtrack you'll never forget
review/text: With everything having been said, there's nothing else for me to say except that the music of Chrono Cross has stood up well over these years and still gives me something new everytime I listen.I love this soundtrack mainly for its most heartfelt pieces; the quiet, simmering compositions that tie everything together in between its most powerful and majestic moments."The Scars of Time" is still one of the best, most original theme pieces ever, and the only one on the soundtrack (if I remember right) which Mitsuda created with acoustic, not synthesized, music. Another piece which stands out is "The Bend of Time" (a.k.a. "Ravine - Cleft of Dimension"), which is played in the game at the island where you may return to battle any of the game's creatures over again. I, however, lacking the soundtrack CD at the time, merely went there to listen to the music and let it loop in the background while I went about my business.Some time later I ordered the CD (unheard of on Amazon at the time), and six years on, "The Bend of Time" is still one of the best pieces to put on for a quiet, sunny late afternoon. When my daughter was born, "The Bend of Time," "Another Arni," "Another Guldove," and "Home Arni" made her lullaby playlist, and these are still some of her favorite pieces.What Yasunori Mitsuda has achieved here is an amazing, all-embracing sweep of the entire spectrum of human emotion. It's upbeat, victorious, adventurous, tragic, dramatic, gentle, nostalgic, hostile -- this is music that, if you let it, will touch your life in ways beyond the TV and the PlayStation controller.

review/summary: Beautiful...
review/text: This is easily the best video game soundtrack of the past several years, mixing a wonderful blend of soothing melodies and heart-pounding battle songs. Many of the reviews I've read on the internet like to list a few tracks that 'stand out' on this 3-disc set, but personally I think you have to listen to it all. When listening to this OST by itself, you really can't skip over any one song, espically if you've played the game all the way through at least once.Moving, spiritual music that really goes above and beyond the call of the genre. Any fan of real music should have this in their collection, it is beautiful beyond reproach. Yasunori Mitsuda is a truely brilliant composer.The liner notes that come with the set are in japanese, but a translation can be found at GameFaqs.com in the Chrono Cross section. All in all, this album is WELL worth the import price, and can be enjoyed by people of any age and musical taste.

review/summary: Really Enjoyed It
review/text: I don't care much for Dr. Seuss but after reading Philip Nel's book I changed my mind--that's a good testimonial to the power of Rel's writing and thinking. Rel plays Dr. Seuss the ultimate compliment of treating him as a serious poet as well as one of the 20th century's most interesting visual artists, and after reading his book I decided that a trip to the Mandeville Collections of the library at University of California in San Diego was in order, so I could visit some of the incredible Seuss/Geisel holdings they have there.There's almost too much to take in, for, like William Butler Yeats, Seuss led a career that constantly shifted and metamoprhized itself to meet new historical and political cirsumstances, so he seems to have been both a leftist and a conservative at different junctures of his career, both in politics and in art. As Nel shows us, he was once a cartoonist for the fabled PM magazine and, like Andy Warhol, he served his time slaving in the ad business too. All was in the service of amusing and broadening the minds of US children. Nel doesn't hesitate to administer a sound spanking to the Seuss industry that, since his death, has seen fit to license all kinds of awful products including the recent CAT IN THE HAT film with Mike Myers. Oh, what a cat-astrophe!The book is great and I can especially recommend the work of the picture editor who has given us a bounty of good illustrations.

review/summary: Essential for every personal and Public Library
review/text: If people become the books they read and if "the child is father to the man," then Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss Geisel) is the most influential author, poet, and artist of modern times. For me, a daddy to a large family who learned to read with Dr. Seuss and who has memorized too many of the books via repeated readings to young children, Prof. Nel's brilliant 'American Icon' is a long awaited treat. At last a serious treatment of this remarkable genius that is both an engaging read and filled with remarkable insights! I especially enjoyed (and learned more than I care to admit from) Prof. Nel's discussions of the Disneyfication of Seuss - which Nel links to failings in American copyright law, "the other sides of Dr. Seuss" - all of which sides were new to me, and the political genesis of his secular morality in the WWII cartoon work he did at PM magazine. The chapters on Geisel's poetry and artwork and the link Nel makes between Seuss and the historical avant guarde alone make this book a "must buy" for parents and serious readers, not to mention public libraries. Readers of Nel's other books will find the same engaging writing style that makes the book a fun read while imparting a mountain of information and important ideas. This is simply the best and most comprehensive book yet written on the work of Seuss Geisel and what will certainly be the standard for many years to come. Thank you, Prof. Nel, wherever you are, from a reader who grew up with the good doctor and who is growing up with him again years later. Your book, written from your encyclopeadic knowledge of children's literature and the media of this genre - from scanning verse to cubist painting! - explains the power, limits, and popularity of the Seuss phenomenon.

review/summary: Phlip Nel gives silly Seuss a serious treatment
review/text: Theodore Seuss Geisel (1904-1991), aka &quot;Dr. Seuss,&quot; was one of the most influential writers and artists of the 20th century.In 1959, Rudolf Flesch wrote, &quot;A hundred years from now, children and their parents will still eagerly read the books of a fellow called Ted Geisel, popularly known as Dr. Seuss.&quot;Flesch was too conservative in his prediction. A century, and more, from today, Dr. Seuss will still be read when many authors on today's bestseller lists will be forgotten.Published on the centenary of Geisel's birth, Dr. Seuss: American Icon analyzes six key aspects of Seuss's career: poetry, politics, art, biography, marketing, and influence.In six insightful chapters, Philip Nel, Assistant Professor of English at Kansas State University, discusses &quot;U.S. Laureate of Nonsense,&quot; &quot;Dr. Seuss vs. Adolf Hitler,&quot; &quot;The Doc in the Smock,&quot; &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. S.,&quot; &quot;The Disneyfication of Dr. Seuss,&quot; and &quot;The Cat in the Hat for President.&quot;Nel gives short shrift to Geisel's childhood and family background--and, indeed, to biography in general--preferring to focus on Seuss's writing and art, from his first book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (1937) to his last book, Oh, the Places You'll Go! (1990).Dr. Seuss's breakthrough year was 1957, when he published the two books with which he is most often identified: The Cat in the Hat and How the Grinch Stole Christmas!Other classic works in the Seussian canon are: Horton Hears a Who! (&quot;A person's a person, no matter how small&quot;), Yertle the Turtle (modeled on the rise of Adolf Hitler), Green Eggs and Ham (Seuss's bestselling book), The Sneeches (a criticism of anti-Semitism), The Lorax (a protest against corporate abuse of the environment), and The Butter Battle Book (a critique of Reagan's enthusiasm for the nuclear arms trace).His favorite work, among the books he authored, was The Cat in the Hat, for it, more than any other, taught children to read.While many of his books have a clear and powerful moral, Seuss had a horror of heavy-handed preaching. He sought to teach and ignite the imagination, but was a lifelong opponent of smug, self-righteous bourgeois moralism.&quot;Seuss was a contrarian,&quot; writes Nel, &quot;who enjoyed challenging people to reconsider their assumptions. [He had a] rebellious imagination and a dispositional distaste for rules and regulations.&quot; His work was a &quot;rational insanity&quot; that exhibited &quot;joyous anarchy&quot; and a &quot;lifelong thrill in misbehaving.&quot;A better subtitle for Nel's work would have been American Icon and Iconoclast.Nel tells of Seuss's early years as an advertising artist and as a agitprop cartoonist. The book, however, is not a biography; it is a serious study in the genres of literary and art criticism.For readers who want more biographical information, Nel recommends Dr. Seuss and Mr. Geisel, by Judith Morgan and Neil Morgan (1995), which he describes as &quot;the definitive biography and the single best secondary source on Seuss. Any discussion of Seuss's life and work must begin with this book.&quot;Dr. Seuss: American Icon includes 103 pages of notes, index, and the most comprehensive annotated Seuss bibliography ever assembled. One learns a lot from this book; the author's lucid style makes it not only an enlightening work but a fun read.Philip Nel is the author of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter Novels: A Reader's Guide (2001) and The Avant-Garde and American Postmodernity (2002).Roy E. Perry of Nolensville, Tennessee, is an advertising copywriter at a Nashville publishing house.

review/summary: Good academic overview
review/text: Philip Nel - Dr. Seuss: American IconThis is basically an academic overview of Seuss poetry, art, cartoons, and the problems with the commercialization of the Seuss name and works after his death. It is not, to any real extent, a biography. Those seeking such should move on.As an academic book it leans on the dry side. It assumes the reader has a fairly good knowledge of Children's Literature and 20th Century cartoons (not the animated kind). Not a book to begin your Dr. Seuss experience with. But if you have read them to your children and are interested about the writing style (there is a good chapter about his poetry) or his art style (not as good a chapter, but still interesting).What interested me the most was the deconstruction of the recent rush to "cash in" on Seuss by Hollywood and advertisers. I think that Nel wants to come down against it, but based on Seuss' background (he started out drawing Flit ads) and the projects he approved during his lifetime; it is a tough argument to make. In the end though Nel does point out that maybe the movies and tie- ins did not have to be so... crass?The book is well researched; lots of neat tidbits are to be gleamed. Early cartoons by Seuss for PM magazine were occasionally (by today's standards) shockingly racist. It makes him a little more human and puts his latter works like the Lorax in a new light.Those in Education may enjoy this background. Fans of Seuss will enjoy the exhaustive bibliography of Seuss's many, many works. Also good list of other works about the man.

review/summary: One of America's greatest creative talents
review/text: "Dr. Seuss: American Icon" by Philip Nel is a thoughtful deconstruction of the life and work of Theodore Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss). In this thoughtful book, Mr. Nel deepens our appreciation for Seuss as a distinctively American poet, artist and educator. The author demonstrates Seuss' wide ranging influence and argues for his rightful place among the most important cultural figures of the 20th century.An English professor at Kansas State University, Mr. Nel uses his historic knowledge to discuss how Seuss' text belongs to a tradition of great nonsense writers. Mr. Nel states that Seuss' carefully-constructed absurdist tales encourage children to challenge the status quo by gently skewering the grown-up world; elsewhere, he uses charts to show how Seuss effectively used meter and rhyme to complement his intentionally ridiculous plots and create masterful stories that have stood up well to the test of time.Mr. Nel recounts Seuss' early career as advertising illustrator and political cartoonist to help us better understand the influences that shaped his classic children's work. As an artist, Mr. Nel suggests that the term "energetic cartoon surrealism" appropriately describes Seuss' creative synthesis of cubism, art nouveau, surrealism and other styles. While Seuss' influence can be detected in modern rap music, children's books, political cartoons and more, Mr. Nel contends that Seuss would not have been happy about the manner in which his works have been posthumously marketed, opining that the "Disneyification" or simplification of Seuss' stories for marketable purposes "threatens to make 'Seuss' synomynous with the ambiguous power of global capitalism". Such commercialism would appear to collide with Seuss' desire to develop critical thinking among young people and to help us all imagine a better world.I highly recommend this book for everyone interested in gaining greater insight and perspective into one of America's greatest creative talents.

review/text: When I recieved this book as a gift for Christmas my first impression went along these line: "Oh great some professor who probably wrote alot of mumbo-jumbo that I don't want to know about Dr. Suess and I know it won't be an enjoyable read."Thanks goodness I read it nonetheless.To my pleasure, Nel hardly writes in the airy academia style with which I expected him to. In fact, he's writes so far from it, with a smart and precise style, I am tempted to revise how I feel about professor-writers. However, in accordance with his academia roots, Nel has a 100 page annotated bibliogarphy that goes along with his work, a nice shrine to prove his homework was well done.As far the actual book goes it is an excellent piece work. "Dr. Seuss: American Icon" looks at the man behind Dr. Suess not as a straight-forward biography, but rather it focuses on different areas of Dr. Suess (i.e. poet, poetry of, artist, artistic style, adult, activist, etc.) and interjects those discussions with biogrphical anecdotes. A very effective attention keeping method.If you're interested in learning more about the work and the man behind the work of Dr. Suess, this is the book that speaks to both and even more. Highly recommended!

review/summary: And to think that I read it on the tram!
review/text: Trams (or any public transport) are not usually the best place to read and absorb scholarly texts. But this one has accompanied me on my daily commute, and I have been absorbed in it. It is well written and comprehensive, and tells the tale of a modern author, with plenty of "Fancy that" and "Well, well" moments. Highly recommended for stationary reading, too.

review/summary: Fascinating account of a genius at work
review/text: As far as I am aware, this is the first book-length study of the work of Dr. Seuss, and Philip Nel has done an excellent job. If the word 'study' makes you nervous, rest assured: this is not a jargon-filled, pretentious analysis. It is, instead, a nicely written work that views Seuss from several different angles: as a poet, a visual artist, a cartoonist, and so on. Nel writes intelligently on how Seuss fits into the canon of nonsense poets, and provides good background on the roots of Seuss's visual style. Some of the WW2/political cartoon material I had read about before, but Nel covers it thoroughly. The most fascinating chapter to me deals with the marketing of Seuss, particularly since his death. Nel holds forth strongly on the abominable 'Grinch' movie (and I trust he feels the same way about the 'Cat in the Hat' film too), and gets into a very interesting discussion of the possible motivations behind the ever-expanding empire of Dr. Seuss Enterprises. (And no, I don't believe it is purely about the profits!)Two small quibbles prevent me from awarding five stars. Firstly, I would have liked the book to be a little longer. The in-depth bibliography is interesting in itself and will be a goldmine to future researchers, but I'm sure Nel could have found a few more things to say - perhaps about Seuss's gender politics. Secondly, the dust jacket on my copy was a little loose.

review/summary: Outstanding Resource for Small Church Pastors
review/text: I just finished the book, &quot;Wonderful Worship in Smaller Churches,&quot; by David Ray, an outstanding resource for small church pastors, as is his other book, &quot;The Big Small Church Book.&quot; I will be rereading both regularly and referring to them often. I may have to reorder the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; as my copy is nearly worn out. If I had only two choices for resources for pastors of small churches, it would be these two.I hope the author considers focusing on Christian Education in another book. There is a section in the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; on Christian Education, but concentrating on one of the most important church functions individually makes a huge difference, as is proven by this new book. I tell all my colleagues that Rev. Ray's books are worth every dollar and more.

review/text: Many small churches feel like they can not have great worship because they lack the resources that larger churches take for granted.Ray's list of "thou shalts" is worth the price of the book.The description of various "personalities" in the small church is both humorous, and so true.This book gives encouragement as well as practical advice.

review/summary: Not Just for Pastors!
review/text: I just finished reading this amazing book and came away with an entirely different perspective on our smaller congregation. As a ministry leader it is easy to become depressed over what can not be accomplished, and how overworked everyone is in a small church...but we often fail to see all that IS being accomplished and how extraordinary our smaller congregations are.There are many pluses outlined in this book about what works about being smaller, and in this day of mega churches the reminder is a good one. There are some very good tips about altering worship for smaller congregations and valuing it's unique size and working with it well.For the thousands of us who find ourselves in churches with membership of 100 or less, for those who are discouraged when worship attendence is 30 or 40 during the summer, this book is such an uplifting perspective you can't help but be energized!Unlike many tomes of this nature, this is an easy read and the layperson can gobble it up and immediately put it to use. David Ray's writing style is accessible and doesn't make assumptions about the knowledge of the reader, offering explanations where needed that were very helpful.Pick it up even if you are not a pastor, you will gain something from it, I guarantee it!

review/summary: Small church pastor? This is the book on worship
review/text: I hadn't been a small church pastor very long before I began to hear about David R. Ray. If you do any reading in this area, you'll start to see other authors refer to him and a handful of others, especially Anthony Pappas and Carl Dudley (who are also excellent). But Ray is different. Reading his work, I felt as if he had actually visited MY home church. He describes some of the personalities in a church family, and I could supply their names. He lists some of the "Thou Shalts" of a strong worship service, and I heard echoes of my most recent deacons' meeting. He not only gets small church culture, he celebrates it, and he is eager to help small churches learn to get and to celebrate themselves. If you are part of a church where low-morale often coexists with feisty pride, this is a resource that will help. It offers some ways of identifying what church families with 50 or fewer need and hope for from their churches, and how to offer it in ways that are inclusive, warm, fun and authentic. Hallelujah!

review/summary: One of My Favorites Naxos Sor Discs
review/text: This is the 9th CD I've purchased in the Naxos 10 CD "complete" solo guitar works of Fernando Sor. I'm surprised that no one else has reviewed it, because it's easily one of the best in the series for pure listening pleasure. Op. 10 and 12, both extended works ("Fantasies"), are quite enjoyable, but Op. 11--which includes a series of 12 wonderful Minuets-- truly seems a masterpiece and is probably one of Sor's greatest works. Listening to these short pieces, one can really appreciate Sor's influence on Agustin Barrios (considered by many to be the greatest classical guitar composer of all time). John Holmquist, one of America's premier guitarists, performs these works skillfully and expressively, with a delightful, singing quality. Highly recommended.

review/summary: not good
review/text: I bought this book because I read some glowing praise on an online library site. Unfortunately, I was deeply disappointed by page three. I always buy books in the hope and expectation of having an enjoyable read, not to criticise. However, this book is in urgent need of good editing -- though quite possibly editing alone wouldn't save it. Examples: a bed squeaks slightly and sharply in the same sentence; a nightgown hangs freely over her girlish figure and olive colored complexion; coffee aromas huddle; rumbling clouds huddle (as well as the coffee?); she prepared to sip her coffee beneath the wrath of God... cuddled within the arms of a strong breeze; (the wrath of God is a breeze?); the Columbian (stet) coffee aroma danced beneath her sculpted tan nose; the coffee bean fragrance tangoed within her body; she placed her thick pink lips against the warm cup;... and so on, all by page three. It is quite possible that the storyline is deeply moving. I'll never know because I can't bring myself to continue. Sorry.

review/summary: Here is my opinion
review/text: I have to admit, I am not one to write reviews on book. I do however like to read them. Some of the reviews are great, some are cruel, but the reviews on this book were absolutlely hysterical. I read this book and after watching the war of the words I couldn't help, but to jump in. I am on the good side of the book. I loved how it kept my intersted. On the bad side I have to say, there was a typo featured on the back cover and the secret to liking this book is making it through the first chapter. I have to admit I was a little curious when I read some of the reviews. They were so mean and false that it spiked my curiosity. I then like the last review noticed that the "Traveling librarian" wrote a completely ignorant review on this book. My first thought was wait a minute, that was not the book that I read. I read my copy once again and realized her entire review was fabricated. Then I knew, it was some kind of game. Maybe it is someone who dislikes the author for personal reasons, that has posted more then one awful review, or maybe this is another who is jealous, Who knows? All I know is that I liked the book, and future readers take the advice of the ignorant with a grain of salt.

review/text: This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a "worst book" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on "To Kill a Mockingbird"--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!

That was funny but also sad that people are mean enough to keep others from an enjoyable read. I loved this book. I thought the first chapter was a little long, but I read the WHOLE book and I loved it. This book is about an afair of the heart and the right to be happy. It is a glimps into the lives of those who are forbiden to love each other. This is a heart warming story. This is a first book and it had a few flaws, but this writer will only get better and better as she goes forward. It was lovely and I am blessed that I read it.

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: I really enjoyed the book. I believe the author did a good job at tackeling the subject of poor conduct in the church. I was reminded that we are all human, and even the mighty shall fall. Now I have to speak my mind regarding the poor reviews. I was shocked at the bahavior of "adults" What happened to respect for others. In my opinion I have to say those who wrote the mean reviews are nothing short of ignorent and without a doubt low class. Yes, there are minor errors in the book, but it did not change the greatness of the story for me. Who cares if a word on the back cover is missing an E? Did anyone stop to think that this book whent through a publisher most likely after it left the hands of Mrs, Haddon? I have to say, I am not one to leave reviews, but I just had too when I saw how this book was misrepresented. Not only was the author butchered, but those who liked the book as well were called illiterate. I agree with a fellow reviewer when I ask, how many of you have written a book? Obviously not many because you all have way too much time on your hands. I liked the book, and remember that those of you in glass houses should not throw stones.

review/text: I have to say that my friends at work all read this book and loved it. It was brought to our attention that there are negative reviews on this book that are false. For example the traveling librarian? We had a discussion about this book at work and the review of the traveling librarian is completely false. I pulled out the book and realized that these are lies and that someone is trying to ruin this book. The book never states that a garden is ten miles long. On page 62 it clearly states that the garden is five acres. No heartbeat of a fetus was heard at a week. How could it be? Julia was not even aware of the pregnancy at that time. The preacher never went to the house to give condolences, after reading the book once again it is obvious that he was there to fix the barn. So...on and ect... I also looked at the reviews &lt;history> all but one of the bad reviews is writen by someone who has never reviewed a book on amazon before. Veronica Haddon if you are reading this you need to write a letter to Amazon. Someon is playing a prank on you !!

review/summary: Wonderful, wonderful book !!
review/text: Just as predicted the first chapter of the book was long. I continued reading and then fell in love with WOTWS. It is heart warming and realistic. I thought it was a little depressing, but I quickly realized the writers point. There is a rainbow at the end of each storm. I did notice the error on the cover, but it only made me love the writer more. This writer is talented and she is not corporate, nor does it appear that she has a staff working for her. Her book was writen from the heart and that is what makes an American literary legend. I would rather read a book with an error then to read hollow perfection any day of the week.

review/text: I thought this book was brilliant, but yet realistic. It showed me that to error is human. I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him. I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down. I also loved The glass castle.

review/summary: Oh please
review/text: I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all.

review/summary: Awful beyond belief!
review/text: I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a "lean" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!

review/summary: You've got to hand it to the author...
review/text: I purchased this book after reading rave reviews of it included within a review of a really good book I'd read. Apparently, the author (or her friends and family) are placing reviews of good books and encouraging people to buy this book if you liked the one they were reviewing. Great marketing by the author. However, the author should probably stick to marketing and give up the idea of being a writer. This book could have been written by a middle-schooler. It is a self-published, self-edited (and extremely poorly edited, I might add), and self-promoted lame excuse for a novel. My eyes rolled constantly while reading this book. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse...it did. The best part of this book is the short length. There is no substance, no character development, and the plot (if there actually is one) is pathetic. I generally trust the reviewers on Amazon. I really feel duped for purchasing this book after reading about it in Amazon's readers' reviews. Don't waste your money. The author should have printed only enough copies for family and friends. The rest of the population should be spared having to read this drivel.

review/summary: You've got to be kidding!
review/text: It has been years since I've read a romance novel. If this is typical of the genre these days, I will never pick up another one. Not only is the plot contrived and juvenile, the writing shows the lack of skill expected only in a child's writing. Many of my seventh grade writing students would be embarrassed if this trash was attributed to them. "The bed squeaked slightly, but her husband was unmoved by the sharp squeaks from the bed as well as the howling noises caused by the wind that were surrounding him." Were the squeaks slight or sharp, and were she and her husband sleeping outside that the wind could be howling around him not the house? This is just one mangled sentence in a book filled with such tripe. If my criticism seems harsh, it's because I actually paid money for this book. What a waste!I would suggest that Miss Haddon go back to Junior High School and begin a serious course of writing instruction. Perhaps by the time she graduates from college she will have gained an understanding of good sentence construction, proper punctuation, and the value of using adjectives sparingly. And if she reads a great deal along the way, she might also learn how to construct a plausible plot.

I read a lot, and I always have. I don't usually like modern love stories, but I gave it a chance and found that I didn't want to put it down until I finished it. I look forward to reading her next book and no I'm not a family member or a friend. Just give her book a chance and you might just find that it really is pretty good.

review/summary: awful beyond belief
review/text: I can't remember the last time I read such a dire book. I howled with laughter all the way through, wondering how much worse it could get - and sure enough, it got worse. If the writing is bad, the plot is ludicrous. A preacher comes to offer condolences the same afternoon that the heroine's husband is shot dead. Within moments they are having sex. The sex is not sensually treated or beautifully described - no, all they do is stick their tongues down each other's throats. The preacher goes to tell his paralysed wife. Her bizarre response - wait for it - is to stick her tongue down his throat. No wonder he veers away. The heroine runs off to work in the heart of Liverpool in a rose garden ten miles long (I kid you not). Did I mention she is dying? But never mind, she'll make a miraculous recovery. She meets another man - even though, conveniently, he's dying too, and she's pregnant by the preacher by now (and, oh joy, she hears the heartbeat of the fetus at a week... truly, a miracle)! The other man lives in castle and is very rich. Of course. They consumate their affair when she sticks her tongue down his throat. Not to worry, she doesn't have to perform this crude tonsil-tickling for long. The preacher turns up again. Everyone in the way drops dead, leaving the coast free for the "wicked saints" of the title to romp without blame or shame into the sunset.I could have kicked myself for buying this book; but I had been fooled by reading a mention of it by a so-called reviewer of The Mermaid Chair (which is a good book.) Then I checked all the other reviews done by reviewers of Ms Haddon's book (you can click on "other reviews" to see what I mean) and believe I have spotted a scam. The reviewers appear to have chosen the same half dozen best sellers to review -- each on the same day! - and in each review of these other genuinely good books they mention Wicked Saints in the most glowing terms. This is cynical piggy-back riding on bona fide books, made worse because this is a very badly edited (and badly written) self published book. I hope few people will be fooled as I was - and as Amazon has been. Be warned!

review/summary: The Best Soundtrack By SquareSoft
review/text: Yes indeed, the game was beautiful. Too bad no one really knows about it. When i played the game I absolutely loved it. A true masterpiece one of squaresofts best by far. But when I got the Soundtrack it was mind blowing. Every Song was on it. Plus the caftsmanship from the director was just overwhelming. The game and soundtrack by far are the best in squaresofts history. Never has there been a great combination. From Listening threw out Disc one which features some really cool Resident Evil only in symphony mode. Yes this Soundtrack is by far the best Video Game soundtrack that I have ever gotten. All I have to say is get the game first once you beat it. Get the soundtrack next. You'll know what I mean by what a true RPG game and music is all about.

review/text: The only critiscm I have about this sound track are the two bonus tracks (which don't appear in the game and add nothing to the preceding tracks on the cds) and the strange morph that one of the tracks (I believe that it is Escape) takes, turning from a good piece of music into something that seems to have escaped from the eighties.Apart from that I can't recommend this OST highly enough, especially Disc 2 - Track 29 -Staff Roll which, unlike the other tracks on the disc, is an acoustic Strings Piece that really shows off Hitoshi Sakimoto's talents as a composer.

review/summary: One of the very best video game soundtracks every
review/text: When I heard the first few tracks of this OST in an ill-fated battle track contest, I can't say I was too impressed. They seemed to be rather bland and even downright boring. However, I used to also think the same thing about the Final Fantasy Tactics soundtrack, which I now adore. That, and I'm not the type to give up on an entire soundtrack after listening to just a few songs once or twice.That said, I took it upon myself to find the Vagrant Story soundtrack, and I forced myself to listen to it. Several times. Dozens of times even. I played it on the PC. In the car, and my portable players. Eventually, it began to grow on me. I began to appericiate its incredibly dark ambience, its undeniable intelligence, the wonderful quality of the synth, and the sheer complexity of the compositions, a delight for people like me who like to analyze things.I think I first realized "I love this soundtrack" when I felt shivers running down my spine while listening to the end of "Climax of the Grayland Case." How beautiful! Or maybe it was when it thought to myself "That heavy piano playing really does remind me of iron!" while listening to "Iron Crab". Or perhaps it was when I was listening to "Staff Roll" and it made my day a little happier when the main melody kicked in at around 4:25.Or perhaps it was a combination of all of these factors and more, or maybe something else entirely, that I can't really describe. All I can know for sure is that this soundtrack has easily become my second favorite soundtrack, with only FFVI's soundtrack being better in my eyes.I wish I could find a better way to describe exactly how I feel about this soundtrack, but I'm just not eloquent enough. That being said, I think I will give some very short reviews of my favorite tracks.1. Climax of the Grayland Case/IncidentThis is what game music should be! How truly epic! This track showcases pretty much all of the styles that will be used in the rest of the game. The highlight for me is at the end when in the game the sun rises over the edge of the broken stained glass window to the sound of one lone trumpet fanfare. Brilliant. You really just have to see it in context at least once to understand.2. Snowfly ForestThe is my second favorite forest theme, second only to "The Calm Before the Storm" from FFX. It's much less dissonant than the rest of the tracks, but not really very melodic either. It sounds like something out of a fairy tale... a very distorted fairy tale. Some of the parts toward the end almost sound Persian.3. Iron CrabThis is by far my favorite battle track. I've never actually played the game this far but just listening to the music I can picture in my head a giant Iron Crab, snapping and lunging. The heavy, low piano provides the iron, and the brass and percussion provide the crab, I think.4. Staff RollThis has to be the best game ending ever. Honestly, I think it's good enough to be the credits role for a high quality film. The best part is when the main melody kicks in at around 4:20 or so.Other great tracks I like include: Wyvern, Bloody Sin, The Last of Rosencrantz-Curly, Headquarters of the VKP, Dark Element, and Limestone Quarry.All in all a very, very good soundtrack, so much more than just "Video Game Music", and really much closer to a film score. A 10/10 for sure.

review/summary: Great buy!
review/text: I purchased a different jacket when I first got my motorcycle, but I only used it for about six months before needing a new one. In my local shop, they had no plus-sized women's jackets, so I was wearing a men's jacket, and the plates weren't in good places to be protective in case of an accident. This jacket runs true to size, and seems more durable than the other brand of jacket I had (Joe Rocket). The two separate zip-out liners are very convenient and easy. I am very happy with the fit and quality. I ride about two hours a day, on the interstate, and my old jacket started to fray at certain seams after only a month or so. I have had this one for over a month, and there are no signs of wear. In addition, the jacket is comfortable from 95 degrees down to 50 degrees (with appropriate clothing underneath, of course). It may work in even colder weather, but I haven't ridden in anything colder than 50. Overall, I'm really, really pleased with this purchase!

If anything could be a "con" its the zippers...when the linings are out, there are a lot of zippers exposed and I often try to zip the wrong ones! The liners are great....keep you dry, keep off the wind, or keep you warm. I have no complaints. The jacket may be short for some people...but I'm very short-waisted and it fits me perfect. I sized up 1 size and it is quite comfortable.

As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players.

review/summary: interplay of traditions across Caribbean
review/text: from publisher:Addresses the interplay of diverse spiritual, religious, and cultural traditions across the Caribbean.Dealing with the ongoing interaction of rich and diverse cultural traditions from Cuba and Jamaica to Guyana and Surinam, Nation Dance addresses some of the major contemporary issues in the study of Caribbean religion and identity. The book's three sections move from a focus on spirituality and healing, to theology in social and political context, and on to questions of identity and diaspora.The book begins with the voices of female practitioners and then offers a broad, interdisciplinary examination of Caribbean religion and culture. Afro-Caribbean religions, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity are all addressed, with specific reflections on Santer&iacute;a, Palo Monte, Vodou, Winti, Obeah, Kali Mai, Orisha work, Spiritual Baptist faith, Spiritualism, Rastafari, Confucianism, Congregationalism, Pentecostalism, Catholicism, and liberation theology. Some essays are based on fieldwork, archival research, and textual or linguistic analysis, while others are concerned with methodological or theoretical issues. Contributors include practitioners and scholars, some very established in the field, others with fresh, new approaches; all of them come from the region or have done extensive fieldwork or research there. In these essays the poetic vitality of the practitioner's voice meets the attentive commitment of the postcolonial scholar in a dance of "nations" across the waters.

review/summary: Ecclesiological Milestone
review/text: With the publication of Everett Ferguson's book on ecclesiology, another milestone has been reached in the scholarly presentation of the distinctive theological perspective of Churches of Christ. The book is divided into six chapters, each roughly sixty to seventy pages in length. Within each chapter, Ferguson neatly and systematically outlines his thoughts and arguments. The first chapter, entitled "The People and the Messiah: History and Eschatology," deals mainly with background issues. It examines the Old Testament teaching on the importance of covenant and the meaning of the phrase "kingdom of God" in its relationship to an and distinction from the church. Ferguson enters into the New Testament and ecclesiology proper via a consideration of Jesus as Messiah, including a careful exegesis of Matt. 16:13-23, where he concludes that the "rock" of Matt. 16:18 is not Peter, but the fact of Jesus' Messiahship. Ferguson's analysis of Matt. 16:13-23 is insightful and carefully articulated. Within this section, he gives attention to "the gates of Hades will not prevail" and concludes with some interesting yet encouraging insight. In the second chapter, "The Church and Her Lord: The Nature of the Church," Ferguson deals with and focuses on three images, "people of God," "body of Christ," and "community of the Spirit." A peculiar feature in this chapter is placing the discussion of the word ekklesia last rather than first. The latter would seem more appropriate and would seem to set the stage for the chapter, especially for a work of biblical ecclesiology. This great section will open the eyes of the reader and renew his focus of church. That is to say, this chapter correctly puts Christ as the head of the church and gives Him His appropriate place. The third chapter concentrates on, "The Church and Her Savior: Salvation and Church Membership." Essentially this section covers soteriology, which determines ecclesiology, but it is not ecclesiology itself. His full treatment of the nature of sin, the meaning of the cross, and the human response to God's saving work is only loosely linked to his topic of ecclesiology. This is not to say that this section is uninteresting or uninformative because it is quite helpful for a fuller understanding of these matters. Far more important is the content of Ferguson's soteriology. Ferguson is strong when it comes to the necessity of baptism. A few statements will give the reader an idea of his position: "Baptism is the time at which one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God" (pg. 170); "Baptism is a `calling on the name' of the Lord" (pg. 180); and, "Baptism is the appointed time at which God pronounces forgiveness" (pg. 183). He concludes: There must be an objective necessity about baptism, or New Testament writers could not speak of baptism in the way they do" (pg. 185). How refreshing! In our world of relativity and ecumenism, people need to hear Ferguson's words, especially those in Churches of Christ. The last three chapters move into a more familiar territory for a treatise on the church. Chapter four, "The Church and Her High Priest: Worship and Assembly" is a great section for anyone interested in the dynamics of worship. Here, Ferguson begins with a type of etymology as a way of introduction, concentrating on both the Greek and English words. This introduction to the subject sets the stage for the entire chapter. Worship is a hot topic today, thus chapter four is rather applicable for our day with all the differing views. This section is multitudinously faceted and exhaustive. "The Church and Her Bishop: The Continuing Ministry" is appropriately the title for the fifth chapter. In this section, Ferguson again touches on some hot topics in the church. It is unfortunate however that he only briefly deals with the debates on miraculous gifts and women's roles. Ferguson advocates a cessasionist position on miraculous gifts and a complementarian position on women's roles, but leaves the reader thirsting for more information and a more comprehensive treatment of the issues. In a day where these two in particular issues are so widely discussed and debated, one would think that they might have received a little concentration. Again, this is not to eradicate what was accomplished in this chapter because it was insightful and obliging, especially given the fact that his discussion on deaconesses was amazingly insightful and well balanced. In chapter six Ferguson adequately covers, "The Church and Her Teacher: The New Way of Life." In this section, he includes an unusually prominent consideration of ethics and a very healthy discussion of the importance of Christian fellowship and its concomitant, church discipline. One last thing that must be mentioned about this chapter is Ferguson's section on unity. Although this section is brief, it is significant and insightful. Ferguson lays out the various aspects of unity and does so in just a few short pages. It serves as an excellent conclusion to a monumental work. Of course, any reader is free to take issue with some of Ferguson's conclusions. For example, the distinction that is made between the temporary and permanent endowments of the Spirit still awaits additional clarification, and there will be those who will score Ferguson, despite his disclaimer, for his synchronic rather than diachronic approach to the New Testament writings. This is a courageous book. Its Reformed-Restorationist slant that the proper doctrine of the church entails a return to the faith and practice of the apostolic church is unmistakable. There are numerous nuggets of exegesis and important points of emphases that make this book worth reading. It is astounding that Ferguson deals with so many facets of ecclesiology in a one-volume work. Not only that, but he also includes a helpful subject index as well as a number of bibliographies. Just a glance at his copious footnotes and it is clear that this book is well researched and well documented. This book should be one that every minister, church leader, and ministry student is required to read and ponder.

review/summary: Early Christian development of the Church
review/text: Everett Ferguson approaches the subject of early christian development with quotes from their early documents in their own words. Ferguson gives us a peek into the minds of early Christians and puts it together in a form one can understand today. The only criticism is that he can get too technical and detailed at times. With patience his writing is able to be followed by a serious student of the subject of God's church. I highly recommend this book for any serious student of the subject!

review/summary: Fashionable Compression Stockings!
review/text: After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings. Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling.

review/text: Excellent product. However, they are very difficult to get on for older people. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. Also, as the day wears on, they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I have to wear them, so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help.

Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!

review/text: Who was Saint Hyacinth? The story starts with a chance meeting in Rome where he witnesses (the future) Saint Dominic raising a man from death. From that point the book is one miracle and amazing encounter on Hyacinth's journey across North Europe. He raised the dead, walks on water, fled the invading Tatars from a Cathedral carrying a 500 lb. Statue. All thoughout he dispenses his own brand of spiruatilty and humility. The book reads liks a combination of a self help book like the One minute Manager and the excitement of the Raiders of the Lost Arc. Kids will love this book to be read to them. They will never forget Saint Hyacinth. I know I never will.

If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix.

It's great looking (I bought the Clear Bubbly one), super-simple to use, and most importantly, produced a beautiful, long-lasting foamy froth. (I use Simply Smart fat-free milk and am very pleased with the results.) Once you've got the foam you want, you can simply remove the metal screen mechanism and pop the jar in the microwave to warm the milk. Delicious!I have a crazy phobia about letting milk sit around for any length of time at room temperature, so if I'm going to use the Foamagic more than once during the day - and I typically do -- I rinse it well with water. I've put it in the dishwasher with good results, but think I'll be handwashing it as much as possible -- I'd hate to see the acrylic crack because of the temperature of my dishwasher.

The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere "out there" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon.

review/summary: A twist (in the wind) ending
review/text: Besides his famousDEVIL'S DICTIONARY, San Francisco newpaperman Ambrose Gwinnett Bierce (1842-1914) wrote many supernatural and Civil War short stories. AN OCCURENCE AT OWL CREEK BRIDGE is best-known of the latter. This French-made short film (28 mins.) of that tale was required viewing in high schools back in the 1960s.The story opens with Confederate sympathizer Peyton Farquhar being executed by hanging from the titled river span. He's pushed, falls, the rope snaps and Peyton lands in the water, unharmed. He manages to free his hands, untie his bound feet and safely escape from a barrage of rifle fire.For a day and night Farquhar flees through an endless forest in the general direction of home-- some 30 miles distant. All through this taxing journey he thinks about wife and kids. Peyton begins to imagine strange sights and noises, and is convinced that he dozes even while walking. After coming to full consciousness near his home, Farquhar runs (in stunning slow motion) with arms outstretched toward his wife. He suddenly feels a blinding pain in the back of his neck...The literary device central to "Owl Creek Bridge" has been reused in many films.JACOB'S LADDER(1990) andCARNIVAL OF SOULS(1962) are just two of these.Licensee of this indie transfer, VIDEO YESTERYEAR (along with RADIO YESTERYEAR) is a specialty company located in Sandy Hook, CT.

review/text: Steven Wardell's book is a pure delight and I've recommended itto friends of all ages. In Rising Sons and Daughters, we learn thatJapanese young people are preserving their country's tradition of respect for their elders while also creating their own identity as Japan's &quot;Generation X&quot;. Like our own young people, they are bombarded with some of the excesses of &quot;Western culture&quot; - Clothing fads, rock groups, a culture of shopping, etc. What they seem to be developing, however, is a healthy hybrid of old and new that retains a firm foundation in good values. The Ando family members are wonderful, memorable people and Stevern Wardell writes poignantly about their lives and hopes of each of them.

review/summary: A fascinating insight into the life of modern Japanese teens
review/text: I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the &quot;New Young&quot; of Japan seem to be creating an &quot;international&quot; blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!

review/summary: Almost a day by day view
review/text: Steven Wardell went to Japan without reading any of the hundreds of books about Japan. He went without any idea of how Japan would treat him. So what he writes seems to come to us without much editing by any pre-made belief. No filters are between us and the experiences he had day to day. All the details about school, family life and learning the language comes to us without any forethought.Compared to other books on Japan this is raw, unmolded, information and is full of insight that I doubt even Wardell realized was amazing for such a young writer. I would say that this is a must for anybody planning on going to Japan for ANY reason.Did find some humor in the fact that Wardell felt the need to explain everything, even what a corn dog was, and that when he met other exchange students one complained about how the Japanese, and I quote, Couldn't even speak English good, end of quote. Couldn't even speak English GOOD? Neither can the exchange students it seems.All in all, you need to get it. Used, paperback, in hardcover, any version you can. Just get it.

review/summary: No roy Orbison fan should be without this!
review/text: First of all, Roy's studio recordings of the 60's were absolute marvels, production masterpieces of their time, and all time. But Roy was also no slouch live, as Black and White Night proved, once and for all. These recordings are of surprisingly good sound quality, and Roy is in good form throughout. If you're a Roy fan, don't hesitate; the price is great and it's all very listenable. Given an extra star because it's NOT overpriced. I wish the corporate giants would take note: it is not necessary to gauge the buyer on old reissues or old &quot;found&quot; material. You'll sell more, which means in the long run, make more. Get it?

review/summary: reasonably priced. reasonably worth it.
review/text: i was leary of this set. if you look at the track listing, you'll notice that there's is an awful lot of repeated material. if you read between the lines, the boxed set warns you of this, boasting that each concert contains "all of orbison's biggest hits," and it is the case that just over half of each cd is repeated material. with boxed sets, i usually like to go disc-by-disc and discuss the merits and flaws of each one, but that seems sort of unnecessary here. suffice to say, there are a few things to keep in mind with this set:first of all, keep in mind that these are "authorized BOOTLEGS", which means that the recordings don't have the most exceptional sound quality. this is the time when having bought that really nice stereo is going to pay off. listening to these bootlegs through a nice big set of speakers with an equalizer and whatnot is going to buy you some extra quality that just isn't there when you're listening through three inch computer speakers (as i'm doing now). that being said, only one of the shows sounds certifiably dreadful (the 1980 show at Stockton) and that is forgivable since there's another disc in the set from the very same year. oddly, the two earlier shows ('69 and '75) are best sounding, though logic dictates that advances in bootleg technology would happen the same way that advances in everything else does.secondly, remember that roy's songs were - typically - heavy on string arrangements that it would have been difficult to duplicate in a live show. the two 1980 concerts feature some lame keyboard parts, but the hokey electronics aren't really overpowering and are easy to look past. for the most part, the arrangements relied on a couple of guitars, bass, piano, and drums. consequently, the songs always sound much more stripped down to their bones than the studio recordings. this isn't a bad thing, necessarily, but one could argue that the "orbison sound" was indebted to those heavy, dramatic, orchestral arrangements, and that the songs lack some of their majesty when played as a five-piece.thirdly, as mentioned before, look at the track listing. EVERY disc contains "only the lonely". every one contains "pretty woman". every one has "crying". you may or may not think that you need that many versions of the same songs, especially since orbison's delivery of them rarely deviates (in form or quality). ask yourself, "will i listen to 'candyman' over and over again, or is this maybe just a little excessive?"fourth, orbison was a steady performer, but not terribly charismatic. furthermore, his music didn't lend itself to wild eyed pandamonium or frantic rock and roll shenanigans. he performs every show with a kind of austere dignity, never giving a bad performance, but also never getting too caught up in the songs that he's singing.fifth, the liner notes here are sparse, but adequate. each disc contains a little bit of information about the particular show, but nothing to involved about orbison's life, or why his live performances were unique or special. that being said, the set is lovingly packaged, with unifying artwork and design between each individual disc. it's obvious that this set - packaged and distributed by the orbison estate - was designed to look professional and respectful of an artist of orbison's caliber (unlike the 4-disc "Legendary Roy Orbison" set which sony carelessly assembled and tossed off without interest an interest in orbison's legacy).finally there's the price. this is where the set is absolved of all of it's flaws. amazon claims that the set lists for something like [price], but i found my copy at a national chain store ... for [price], which means that even if there were only two discs worth of listenable material, i'd still only be paying about [price] per cd, which is pretty normal. my only real complaint about the purchase was that the earliest show was from '69, and that there were two shows from '80. i would've preferred something more varied: after all, that's only 11 years for a man whose career was practically three times as long as that.dedicated orbison fans shouldn't miss this one. he was pop's master balladeer, and he's always in exquisite form here, even when the other factors (recording quality, repetition of material, etc.) don't do him justice. there was never a singer like him before, and there hasn't been once since.

review/summary: ORBISON'S MUSICAL TIME MACHINE
review/text: Roy Orbison was one of those rare vocalists whose live performance could equal and indeed surpass his recorded work.So it is with this superb collection of recordings from various concert performances.There is,of necessity,repetition of the tracks.Orbison fans came to hear the great songs and Roy gave them what they came for.Few artists could sustain a whole show with nothing but their own self-composed million-sellers like the Big 'O'.Listening to these recordings transports me back to the magic of a Roy Orbison concert.Hear the beautiful sweeping power of his voice,the death-defying leaps on the highest notes,the poetry of his lyrics.From disc to disc their are subtle nuances,little changes in emphasis,inflexion and tone.Throughout there is sheer brilliance of the highest order.

review/text: I recently bought this charger kit from Amazon and I am quite happy with my purchase. The folding plug is nice for storage. The included 1850 mAh batteries last for a long time in my Nikon Coolpix 2100. One of the best features of the charger is that each battery is charged separately (as opposed to in pairs) so that each battery gets just the right amount of charge. The short 3 hour charge time is great as well. The batteries do not get overly warm while charging either.Overall, this is a good charger for a good price. If you have a high drain device, the Kodak K2000 should keep you playing for a long time.

This charger even charges up my SONY AA batteries that came with the camera.Highly recommended!

review/summary: Problem with charging smaller AAAs
review/text: I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is.

I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on.

review/text: This is simpily the best rechargable batteries I have ever own!But there is a slight issue in which is the reason why I have to return this for something else - different mAh ratings!The charger comes with 1700mAh Batteries!!! Not 1850!!!!!!I purchase this for use in my GPS/GMRS radios (which eats 3 per unit). So natually, I purchase this charger with extra Kodak Max K2000 batteries (same product name, and pretty looks the same in picture) but the problem is that the extra set is rated at 1850! I was planning to use those on my gps, but if the ratings are different, my data between the units might be incorrect.Bottom line, if 4 batteries are all you need, or you can use them in sets of 2 or all 4 at once. GO FOR IT!!! I am a gadget freak and I test many different products frequently. When it comes to batteries - this is it, hands down.

Another plus is that the plug folds under when not in use. That makes the unit even more compact and the plug is less likely to scratch something when stored away.

review/summary: Great Compact Charger
review/text: I need a fast, compact charger that could easily fit into my digital camera bag. Other chargers are compact, BUT the electric cord takes up a lot of room. This charger DOES NOT have an electric cord to contend with, Instead, it has a collapsable plug, which folds completely hidden into the unit when not in use, allowing it to be placed neatly into the camera bag pocket.With the storage issue taken care of, the performance of this unit is above expectations. The recharging process is less than 3 hours. Unlike other models, you can recharge either one, two three or all four batteries at once and still get a full charge on all batteries. The two battery option is nice for my kids walkie-talkie batteries. The shut down mode when complete is a nice option that is really needed, especially for the time when you forget about the charger until the next morning.I've tried several other chargers and this is the BEST model that I have worked with. Compact, easy storage, fast charging, auto shutdown, charge less than 4 at a time. ALL the options I need for a battery charger.

review/summary: Fast Charges; Long Lasting Power--but weak spring mechanism.
review/text: The charger makes quick work out of charging all four batteries simultaneously, and automatically shuts off when finished, which is very convenient--no more burned out batteries.Also, the batteries, 1850 mAH, which come with this charger seem to be the highest rated you can buy, and do last very long. Just out of the box, without prior charging, they already outperfomed the Alkalines I had been using previously in my Canon A70. Definately a great buy.One complaint, however, is that the springs that come down to hold smaller AAAs in place break too easily, and will not firmly hold AAAs in place while charging. This has absolutely no affect on Double A batteries, but is an annoyance when trying to charge triple A batteries. It will still charge them, but it's a hassle trying to get the batteries to stay in place when the clip does not hold them sturdily.Overall, a sufficient battery charger. If you are just using it to charge AAs, this is perfect. If you will primarily be charging AAAs, I would look into a different charger, perhaps one that does not involve spring-loading holding mechanisms at all.

review/text: After reading the reviews, I bought this charger. It is everything the positive reviewers are saying. It is simple to use, just fold out the electric prongs and plug into a wall outlet or extension cord. In 3 hours, up to 4 NiMH AA batteries are charged (you can charge 1 to 4 batteries at a time). This charger will shut itself off when it is done charging--in 3 hours. It has lights for each battery telling you when it is charging and the lights go out to let you know that the batteries are fully charged. Since the electric prongs can fold in, the charger can easily fit into a camera bag, or pocket. It is about 2-1/2" by 5" (inches) in dimension. This is an excellent product!!!

review/text: I bought this charger to go with my handheld Garmin GPS unit. Once I got this unit, I did some testing using Energizer batteries. I did a full charge of these batteries and they ran as long if not a bit longer than the Energizer batteries. So once you calculate that these can be charged 800 times, they are a MUCH better deal than buying normal batteries all the time. I also bought a 4 pack of the 1850mAh batteries because all the reviews said the charger came with 1700's and the 1850's were that much better. They were wrong, the charger came with 4 1850's so save your[money]on the extra pack.

review/text: I have really enjoyed using these 1850 NiMH Batteries - they last quite a long time in my A70 digital camera and CD player and the charge time is very quick compared to others. Plus, the fact that you can charge each battery individually is very nice, since it prevents overcharging of any battery. Others charge 2 batteries at once and that assumes that both need to charge as long as the other. Also, the charger works well with AA and AAA NiCad and NiMH batteries. Great buy...

review/text: I just bought this battery charger a few months ago and it works PERFECTLY with my Canon PowerShot A60. It charges up to 4 AA or AAA batteries in LESS THAN 3 HOURS ALL THE TIME!The charger is small and easily portable so you can bring it with you anywhere for quick charging.The only downside to the charger I have found so far is that you can't leave it in the outlet overnight or it will overheat, so you have to come back to it in 3-4 hours. Other than that, this is THE charger to buy!

review/summary: To "Disappointed" in Miami
review/text: You said "...but the charge only lasts a very short time."Did you know that new Ni-MH batteries must be cycled 3 to 5 times before they hold a full charge? This does not mean that they should be charged 3 to 5 times in a row but rather that for the first 3 to 5 charge/discharge cycles, the batteries reach a higher charge level each time until they are recharged until they finally reach their rated capacity. This may be your problem. Try doing this and you might be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: This is an excellent book. It offers the opinions of a diverse sample of real Muslim Women with very different attitudes. It will not appeal to those who don't want to listen or who want an anti-islamic feminist political tract. The value of this is that you hear the opinions, educated and not, of the real people involved.Most of the time, the real voices are ignored and what is presented in the name of feminism is non-muslim american female TV personalities yacking endlessly on about the lives and experiences of people they really don't know and don't want to know.What must be understood above all else is that if you wish to change a society or a culture, you must at the very least understand how the people in that culture who disagree with you think. That is what this book does so well. I may not agree at all with the opinion of every woman in the book, but I at least understand how they think after finishing it.What many will never understand is that Islamic Society has changed and is still changing. But it can only change by consensus from within. No amount of cultural imperialism from western countries is going to change anything for the better.There is also more than a little hypocracy. For all the lectures about the veil from American Women, few of them stop to think about why they are themselves forced into certain choices. A veil isn't great, but its a whole lot more confortable than the pantyhose that many Western women must wear effectively as a condition of employment. One wonders at a certain point if its the veil itself they object to or that as constrasted to their money-driven appearance decisons, the veil has a meaning beyond the secular.

review/text: I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but "more than equal." Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen

review/text: Although written with script authors et al in mind, Dramatica for Screenwriters is the perfect companion book for Dramatica: A New Theory of Story.Using witty and easy to understand examples, the author takes you systematically through the process of turning a meager idea into a full-blown, grand argument story via Dramatica Theory definitions. With a slight mental adjustment, the tips and advice in this book fit the novelist's dilemma as well as the screenwriter's. If you are exploring the world of Dramatica, you need this book on your shelf.

review/text: Sorry for any mistake I could do here, English is not my first language.While Dramatica is a powerful tool for building a story, it is complex and sometimes overwhelming. Armando Salda&ntilde;a-Mora found a way to demystify Dramatica and give a lot of practical advices and principles for creating a story with Dramatica."Dramatica for Screenwriters" is easy to understand, fun and thought-provoking. The only drawback is that this book is not useful if you do not know the Dramatica Theory or do not use Dramatica software. Now, if you're a Dramatica user or if you plan to seriously evaluate the software, it is a must-have.

review/summary: Thoroughly Confusing
review/text: I purchased this book based on the other reviews claiming that it "demystifies" the Dramatica theory and software. Unfortunately, I found the opposite to be the case.I've made numerous attempts to get my head around the principles of the Dramatica theory, with the intention of finally being able to put to use the rather pricey Dramatica Pro software I bought years ago. Both the software itself, and the book of theory explaining it ("Dramatica: A New Theory of Story") are so riddled with specialized (and somewhat proprietary) jargon that I've long counted myself among the number of users for whom the effort to grasp the principles involved outweighed the potential benefits. (And BTW, I'm no newcomer to the basic premises of story structure; I've got an MFA from a respectable film school, and have worked for many years as a film editor.)I'd had high hopes for "Dramatica For Screenwriters", figuring it would serve as a practical layman's guide to understanding and using the software. Unfortunately (there's that word again), despite claims in the author's introduction to the contrary, a few pages in the jargon begins coming at the reader hot and heavy, and unlike in "Dramatica: A New Theory of Story", which I already found to be too opaque, here much of the jargon is not even explained in a cursory manner. Reader familiarity is assumed, which would seem to defeat the purpose of the book in the first place. So the reader is left with a bit of a Catch-22: if you need the book, you probably won't understand it, and if you can understand the book, you probably don't need it.

review/summary: Practical Guide to a Complicated Process
review/text: Dramatica is a pain in the ass to learn. The main book is dense, repetitive, dilatory and slow. DRAMATICA FOR SCREENWRITERS is the opposite! The writing flows easily. It's directs you to the easiest possible paths for getting started. It encourages you to take action and walks you through it. It provides good theoretical guidance without getting bogged down.This is the book that should come with the software for everyone, not just screenwriters. It gives anyone who reads it the ability to jump into A STORY and get it done. Once you've gotten A STORY done you can use Dramatica to alter it for it's media (you may need the main book to get you there). You can also get more stories done with it. Dramatica is not intuitive software. You need to use it from a number of angles to get the hang of it. DRAMATICA FOR SCREENWRITERS gets you there. The main Dramatica book doesn't. READ THIS BOOK FIRST.

review/summary: Even as a fiction writer, I found this book invaluable
review/text: I think the hardest thing for people coming to Dramatica the first time is understanding that the theory and software are not designed to write your story for you (or tell you what your story is about), but rather to tell you, based on the way you answer all the hundreds of questions, what the best storyform or context is from which to tell your story in the way you want.[...]I did the work to know the theory, but "Dramatica for Screenwriters" really helped me understand it. Even though I am a fiction writer and not a screenwriter, I found that most of this book applies to any kind of fictional world building. I highly recommend it.Don't buy the book thinking it's going to take the place of doing the work of getting to know the theory. It assumes prior knowledge.

review/summary: Good structure makes good bones for story
review/text: Beauty is in the bones. This book gives your story good bones, and you end up knowing why. It is a clear explanation of how to do the structure of a story so the end product is a top model. You have to supply the writing, a big commitment, but you won't have the feeling when you're done that something is incomplete or wrong - and all your work goes to something which misses the mark.We have all seen too many movies where the verdict is "Interesting!" To a writer, this is deadly. It means that all the work of director and actors and film crew, editors and producers, went for naught because the starting place, the script, had the final flaws buried in its pages. Use this book and your story will have a coherence and an internal logic that will be solid and subtle - and when you put on it the forensic anthopologist's 'layer of flesh,' what will stare back at you will be a thing of beauty.

Even if you aren't a native speaker like me, having german as my mother tongue. I would never have made it with the DRAMATICA SOFTWARE if I haven't had this book. Believe me. It's worth every Cent (I payed in Euro). Though I tried very hard for roundabout 2 years I was coming to fail with Dramatica 4.0. This book saved my ass. Let it save yours too. It's making me happy.

review/summary: Does what it says it will
review/text: This is a nice combo DVD/VCR. I've had it for a couple of years now and have had no problems. That's really why I'm writing; I want to let people know the ones with problems are probably the exception rather than the rule.The only disadvantages to this product for me:1) On the VCR, you can't FF by time (a panasonic feature; FF a given number of minutes)2) Once you set the VCR program, you must hit TIMER (not just power off) to get it to use the program. Okay, hitting TIMER will turn the power off, but let's say you want to record something later in the week. You will turn your deck on and off several times in that period. Do you want to hit TIMER every time? And by the way, hitting TIMER doesn't just turn the deck off, it switches to DVD mode. In theory, this is nice so you can still use your DVD player while recording a show. In practice you just end up turning off two things (VCR via TIMER, DVD via power) most of the time.3) No S-video input. I had to buy a S-video to composite video adapter to record something from my PC video card. By the way, don't do this; the quality is pretty low.Little advantages to this product for me:1) Front panel inputs; I use this to dub from my video camera very often2) Comprehensive remote; for me, the more buttons the better. I hate on-screen menus. How can I see what the picture looks like when I adjust the tracking if 88% of the screen is the tracking menu?3) Many flavors of A/V OUTPUT: digital audio (coax and optical), composite video (of course), component video (nice for home theater), S video.Bottom line: A good combo deck for the money.

review/summary: Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did!
review/text: This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$.

review/summary: Great Combo Package!
review/text: I decided to wait over a year to write a review on this unit, and thankfully my opinion since the first day I got it hasn't changed. It's wonderful! I was suprised to find a full feature DVD player included. A friend of mine bought a relatively expensive DVD player and it didn't have some of the features this unit has (albeit its a bit smaller). I have never experienced performance issues while using the DVD player in 12+ months. Zoom feature comes in handy as well, if you rent DVDs and don't necessarily want the whole long apect ratio. VCR works great as well. Recordings done in SP look excellent, colors are great and its not grainy at all. EP recordings look great for being EP as well, if you sit back on the couch you can't tell the difference. Only problem there is sometimes it takes a few seconds to track with EP, but it normally finds the right setting fairly quickly. The remote is easy to use once you learn it. It can be confusing at first, but now I wouldn't use anything else. It can control all the TV functions as well at the combo unit. If you want to take a small step into the world of DVD players, but not let go of your old VHS tapes, this is the player for you. Especially now, with the price quite reduced from when I bought it. You will not be disappointed!

review/text: I've had this for just over a month. I had read other reviews on this product prior to purchasing, and to me it seemed like it had received good reviews as simple-to-use machine with good attribues for not-so-electronic-literate person like myself. It had been working just fine, until few days ago I was playing a DVD and all of a sudden it would freeze, and on the TV screen there would be many different colored squares, completely distorting the image. And now, the Dvd player does not even recognize any format (I've tried CDs, DVDs, and even VCDs), as it only says &quot;Incorrect Disc&quot;.I just now found another review where the person had the same problem, had to take it to a local service center, got fixed, came back, and the exact same problem popped back up three weeks later.Reading that, I don't even know if I want to even bother taking it to get it fixed. Since it still plays VHS perfectly fine, maybe I'll just invest in a simple DVD player, which defeats the whole purpose of why I bought a DVD/VHS combo player in the first place....

review/text: Overall, this player works great and was fairly easy to set up. However, the display is ugly (orange lettering that reminds me of my alarm clock) and only displays minutes, not seconds. Also, the lack of universal remote is a drawback. Finally, I was disappointed to learn that you can only record on the VCR in SP (2 hr) or EP (6 hour) speeds. Maybe this is standard now, but I've always liked LP mode for taping movies so you could fit two on a tape. This stuff may seem trivial. Anyway, that's my two cents.

If you do you may not have set the tape to the right speed,you have to do it manualy.The one thing that bugs me is when you have the timer program on and you want to use the vcr you have to shut the timer off and when your done turn it on again or your prgrams will not record.

The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a &quot;incorrect disc&quot; message.

review/text: I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it.

review/summary: One very useful Product for the Video Enthusiast
review/text: This is one of the newest and hottest new combination DVD/VCR combinations on the market today. Upon picking up my purchase of the HR-XVC1U I was impressed. The finish and construction of this product is first rate, and it provides just about every feature one could hope for in a combination unit. Although it does not provide progressive scan for the HD TV owner, for those of us who have a 2 to 3 year old large screen set of 32 - 36 or projection size, it performs admirably. It will play SVHS tapes, and record and play VHS with a clarity I have not seen even on my older SVHS unit. It will also record VHS and show a DVD at the same time. Hook ups and Outputs will impress even the most demanding. The DVD will play all DVD and CD formats. The Remote, it should be noted, is not Universal with the exception of other JVC products, and the Users manual was obviously written by someone with English as a second language. However, if you are able to look past these small limitations, you will not be disappointed. I highly reccomend this product.

review/summary: Perfect for its price!
review/text: I purchased this JVC VHS/DVD combo player after my old VCR pooped out and when I decided I needed a DVD player in my room in addition to the one in our family room. I bought this player when it first came out; VHS/DVD combo players were brand new and seemed much more sensible than separate players. However, I had reservations about this unit, wondering if the quality of the DVD and VHS portions would suffer since both were crammed into one box. My fears were unfounded-- this indeed is a fantastic player!First, I really enjoy the chrome finish; it perfectly matches my silver 24&quot; flat-screen TV. Second, I love the unit's included remote. All of the buttons are solidly formed, and the rew/play/ff/rec/stop/pause buttons glow in the dark for watching movies late at night. Third, the quality of VHS recording is wonderful. I don't know what other reviewers are talking about when they complain of poor quality tape recording; everything I've taped, even on the &quot;EP&quot; (extra-long play) setting, has come out wonderfully. Sometimes, programs taped on certain VCRs look fuzzy on other sets in the house (i.e. if I try to record downstairs with a different VCR and play it back in my room), but anything I tape with this JVC unit is crystal clear on each set in our house. Fourth, I love the different A/V options the JVC unit is capable of utilizing. The JVC unit allows RCA, composite, S-Video, and component cable connections, so use whatever connection works with your TV. I strongly recommend using the component cable hookup as it offers the highest-quality picture. Fifth, I love the functions of the DVD player. Not only does this JVC player offer standard DVD functions like subtitles and markers, it also offers cool functions like zooming. DVDs, CDs, CD-Rs, and VCDs are supported, but SVCDs are not. Sixth, this quality piece of equipment comes at a great price. JVC makes a great unit, and the price is affordable, so don't buy another brand in hopes of getting a better deal.The JVC VHS/DVD player has several A/V options, provides high-quality recording, looks great, comes with a super remote, supports many popular disc formats, and does all of these things for an affordable price. If you're looking for a high-quality, yet modestly-priced piece of equipment to handle your VHS and DVD needs, look no further than this great JVC unit.

review/summary: it's a good quality unit for the money
review/text: Trying to get two audio pieces into one box, offering decent quality, plenty of useful features & low cost may be impossible. I looked at many brands. I needed a unit that has "optical" output for DTS & 5.1 digital to go into my Marantz SR 8000 audio receiver. The cheapest units do not have this, so stay with the better name brands. At this price point I seriously doult that any brand will be very reliable. These units are not being made in Japan, which stood for excellent quality. Instead, China, Tawain, etc. are making them. Making two units into one may save on some costs, but the cost cutting may be the use of cheaper parts inside. So don't expect much from these units.I wanted to replace my older DVD player with one that plays CD-R, CD-RW, and MP3. I purchased the JVC HRXVC1, based on good reviews. JVC is the inventor of VHS vcr, and I have known people to have good luck with their electronics. I also like Panasonic,which makes very reliable electronics. I have had 3 good vcrs with Panasonic, but the clerk said that they were having higher than normal returns on their combo players. Had it not been for that, I would stay with Panasonic.This JVC HRXVC1 vcr/dvd combo has more than enough features needed to play tapes & discs. At this pricepoint it appears to be one of the best featured units I've seen. Hooking it up to my surround receiver was difficult, probably just my fault, although the book isn't clear on the hookup of the "optical" setup with the receiver connections with VCR, etc. Once hooked up, it was worth the effort. The setup was quick and easy. The cds sounded great. The dvd's are crystal clear. The vcr recorded tapes are playing good, and no problems....The GOOD: 1).It works & sounds great. 2.) It looks great on the shelf as well. 3.) There are plenty of features for the money such as Skip Search, index serch, zero return, and three step zoom. 4.) There are front inputs for camcorder or mp3 player to record easy. 5.) This unit has "SQPB" S-VHS Quasi playback which will play S-VHS tapes, and makes for excellent looking viewing of standard tapes. 6.) It has 19um head, for better picture quality in EP mode. 7.) It includes "Spatializer N-2-2" surround for people whose sytems are not setup for surround sound yet. 8.) In use, the rewind & forward is very fast.The BAD: 1.) the remote [is not good]. 2.)the buttons on the box seem unorthodox in their layout. 3.) it's confusing getting around from vcr to dvd, as some buttons have dual use, and buttons are on both sides of the unit. Petty problems, but at least the unit works fine- so far. If it proves to be unreliable, I'll write back.

review/summary: Good DVD Average VCR
review/text: Usually anyone purchasing a combination DVD/VCR player has particular criteria they are meeting in order to get both forms of video into their television. Space, convenience, budget among other reasons comes to mind. That aside, looking at an actual unit the person is most likely more interested about the VCR. DVD reproduction at this level looks so good that it is almost a given fact that it will perform up to someone's expectations. The VCR is another matter. For my own needs I am concerned about the playback of pre-recorded tapes and playback of home VHS recordings that I made. How the DVD/VCR player records in VHS is also important but to a lesser degree. JVC brand VCRs are an interesting and confusing animal when it comes to playback of tapes. I own two JVC S-VHS recorders with flying erase heads. I also own several SONY and older RCA VCRs from the good old days. The problem with JVC is that they play certain tapes back beautifully and others dreadfully. I took several samples of video tape recordings and demonstrated playback on this unit just to see for myself. (I know salesmen at a local electronics store in the area and they always let me try out equipment. They just love low-end technology guys like me.) Pre-recorded movies looked acceptable and I really mean no better than acceptable. Recordings I made on my JVC units in SP and EP modes looked excellent on this unit. Recordings I made on my other SONY units in the SP mode look very good. RCA recordings in SP look average. Recordings I made on my other SONY units in the EP mode looked horrible. They looked like blurred images without any trace of definition. Recordings I made on my other RCA units in LP and EP modes again looked blurred without any trace of definition. However, I made an actual recording on this unit from a satellite broadcast and the playback looked excellent. The bottom line on this unit is that the DVD side looked very good and the VCR performed just about the same as my stand-alone units which I own. There were really no surprises. When I make recordings at home I indicate which VCR the recording was made on just for the very reasons I mentioned above. After many years I have found that a recording usually looks best when played back on the unit it was made from. The reality today is that VHS is an outdated but necessary technology because many of us have a monetary and/or sentimental investment in tape recordings. I think this JVC unit is good but I rate it based upon how I would be using it relative to my library of VHS recordings and how they are going to look.

review/summary: Easy Set Up
review/text: Love this machine! Works great! Set up was easy, although I probably made it harder than it needed to be.I spent some time trying to understand the manual. I finallly just went for it and found setting up the machine was easy.I connected the cable to the dvd player, the color coded cords from the DVD player to the TV &amp; TADA! I was done.I was able to view a VHS tape immediately or switch to a DVD. What's nice about this machine is that I don't have to got through a lot of gyrations to view a DVD or VHS tape. The Sanyo I used to have required all kinds of set up just to view a DVD. (The moon had to be in Aquarious in the seven house and the planets had to be in alignment, just kidding). But seriously, I had to write down the steps for the Sanyo just to remember how to use it. Don't think you'll have that problem with this machine. A happy customer.

review/summary: Great VCR/DVD
review/text: I have to say that this is a great DVD/VCR player. The vcr picture is clear and sharp. I wish that it had VCR+, but instead you have to program the tv shows you want to tape mannually. There should also be an eject button on the remote for the vcr. It's easy to set up, although the user manul is a little confusing, and when you are done setting up what you want to record you have to press the timmer button in order for it to record the shows you want, which is a little annoying. The DVD is great, it also had a clear and sharp picture and works great. I would reccommend buying this JVC combo, because it works great, easy to set up and very little trouble.

review/text: I got this machine primarily for the DVD with MP3 playback. It turns out, that most DVD players with MP3 capability don't allow you to select "random" playing of the tracks!??? I replaced my 12 year-old CD player and my sub-par VCR with this one machine. I'm very happy with it so far, although I wish it had another component input in the back. The DVD playback is awesome. The VCR playback seems fine as well, although since getting TiVo, I don't really use it that much. I recommend this to anyone who wants a versatile player of good quality.

review/summary: Great DVD, mediocre VCR
review/text: This is a fine unit for DVD playback, and has a lot of great features. But my experience with the VCR side left a lot to be desired. The machine has been saddled with a sub-par tuner which makes for noisy, color smeared VHS recordings, and its playback of factory pre-records isn't all that great either (but I will say that EP recordings don't fall off very much quality wise from SP, although the frequency response at both speeds is pretty atrocious). JVC brags about how it's the inventor of VHS. . . shame they couldn't do better here.

review/text: I'm a JVC nut...I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one bookshelf audio system and car audio system. So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be. I decided on the combo player because I don't think VHS is going to be around much longer. I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono...wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it. VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT!!!!!!!

review/summary: Made me wish I was Einstein.
review/text: Not much I can say about this book... It's full of VVVery difficult number puzzles... at least for me. Okay, so I don't get 'A's for my grades at school, but I think that even you might find it a little difficult. The way I see it, you will need lots of paper, patience and time, say 30 minutes or so to solve even the easiest of these.Why? Because basically, you are asked how many combinations can be formed from such and such. Example: How many ways get 31241 by adding prime numbers only? This is not really what the problems are like in the book, they are far more complicated than that.For me, it's just too much. I can't even do 1 single problem. I can't even look up the answers because uses some sort of a legend that I can't understand. But if you have an above average intelligence or are mathematically gifted, you will probably find some obscure short cut to the problem a la Gauss. For the rest, forget it.Word of warning: these are purely number problems. I can't tell if logic will help or even plays a part in this book, but the problems are NUMBER problems.

review/text: This book appears to be a "print on demand" style book which manifests itself, in this case, as a poor quality hardcover. Some of the text is laughably bad, the few images near the end look like they are snapshots from a black and white TV screen, but most bothersome is the "muddy" look of the text. The price seems a bit steep for such a poor quality print. That said, the actual content is very comprehensive. One of the authors (Gray) is co-creator of the now commonplace LBG (Linde Buzo Gray) VQ algorithm. Fortunately, the quality of the content shines through the terrible printing.

There is, in my opinion, no problem with the printing at all, clear, quality monochromatic printing.With respect to the contents of the book, it has almost everything you may want to know about Vector (and even Scalar) quantization and Signal compression. It was a great help while I was writing my doctoral thesis. Gray is probably one of the most respected authorities in the field.

review/summary: Brilliant Words and Harmony
review/text: A fantastic collection of songs by one of Germany's top songwriters and singers. Similar to Simon and Garfunkel with a bit of Bob Dylan. Haunting melodies and brilliant lyrics.Mey is an impressive talent. This collection of twelve songs include social commentary (Atze Lehman, Zwischen Keiz and Ku'damm, Mein guter alter Balthasar), love songs (both love in bloom -Du bist die Stille (You Are the Stillness)- and love in gloom - Einen Koffer in jeder Hand (A Suitcase in Each Hand) and Es schneit in meinen Gedanken (It's snowing in my thoughts) as well as Mey's trademark humorous songs,The latter include: (1) &quot;Weil Ich ein Meterologe bin&quot; (Because I am a Weatherman) which describes the plight of a weatherman who everyone despises because of his poor forecasts (2) Die Homestory (The Homestory) which describes a celebrity's encounter with journalists ostensibly coming to interview him for an article on how his career began but who over spend their time eating and drinking to the extent that when the article finally appear it describes him as &quot;speechless how it all began&quot; because the journalists have not done their jobs (3) Hab Erdol in Garten (I Have Oil in My Garden) about a homeowner who decides to plant strawberries in his garden and apparently discovers oil. After all the changes this brings (fame, lost friends appearing), he discovers that all he has done is rupture an oil pipeline. (5) Es gibt tage, da wunscht Ich, Ich war mein Hund (There are Days I Wish I were My Dog).If you understand German, you will obviously enjoy this CD more. The CD includes the lyrics (in German) which can be a real help if like me you are not fluent.If you don't speak German, sit back and enjoy the music.

review/summary: Addictive, Posh Fun
review/text: Hotel Babylon is a witty, clever, and utterly addictive 2006 British television series launched in the States via BBC America in 2007. The formula is fool proof: assemble a hotel staff of strongly drawn characters, each with a secret past; add dashes of sexual tension, avarice, silliness and whimsy; then, in each episode fold in a parade of hotel guests, everyone arriving with their own baggage of deceit, pathos, and lunacy. The result is a comedy that has dark dramatic undertones, and a drama that breaks into giggles when the tension reaches a breaking point.The promotional trailers aired on BBCA did not do this justice. Those soundbites made it seem as though the series was a debauched soap opera designed to attract a viewership of self- pleasuring adolescent boys. What a delightful surprise to find such a well-written, well acted series. Serious subjects such as immigration raids and drug trafficking crimelords shift stage with rock stars who refuse to party and sophomoric revenge raids on rival hotels.The action centers around Charlie (Max Beesley), the deputy general manager with a murky past, as he adjusts to his new status in one of London's swankiest hotels. The rest of the staff (many it seems have either shagged him or want to) make his job a challenge, but ultimately pull together to solve the myriad of crises brought on them daily by the guests, who are all played by major stars themselves. (Anthony Stewart Head as the suicidal jingle writer will have you falling off your sofa choking with laughter; Joan Collins as the aging noblewoman will leave you wistful). As the series progresses, the viewer comes to feel sisterly sympathy for the sluttishly obsequious receptionist Anna (Emma Pierson), and certain conspiracy with the barmaster Gino (Martin Marquez). For me? My secret crush has always been Tony the Concierge (Dexter Fletcher), as he knows all, sees, all, can solve all, and is the most centered and upright of them all.You won't regret purchasing this DVD. Each episode is a little treat unto itself (e.g. Episode Six, a homage to Hitchcock, must have been a hoot to film; it's a treasure to watch). You'll enjoy watching and re-watching for time to come.

review/summary: "Guilty Pleasure?"...Nope, Just Good TV
review/text: HOTEL BABYLON has to be one of the most incorrectly-advertised TV shows I've seen. When airing on BBC America this past summer, it appeared to be some glamourized soap opera with sexy women. BBC American salaciously promoted it on "Wicked Wednesdays". These commercials didn't even hint that HOTEL BABYLON was actually a breezy, fast-paced, funny, and surprisingly truthful look at a 5-star London hotel's happenings.Each of the 8 episodes begins and ends with narration by Charlie (Max Beesley), the Deputy Manager of the hotel. Think Augustus Hill from OZ, or the opening quotes from THE WIRE. Charlie's philosophical monologues on the hotel business cleverly bookend each episode. Other characters include:Rebecca (Tamzin Outwaithe) - the workaholic hotel managerTony (Dexter Fletcher from LOCK, STOCK, & TWO SMOKING BARRELS) - a loyal concierge who's mostly the moral center of the showAnna (Emma Pearson) - the superficial receptionist you can't help but put up withThere are other hotel faces that you'll learn along the way, and each is given an appropriate amount of screentime. Cameos don't steal the show, and reoccuring characters are well-balanced throughout the season.What separates HOTEL BABYLON from other tongue-in-cheek comedy-dramas is that although the stories in this show are exaggerated, they all carry a dose of reality. Should there be strange noises and electrical failures during the midnight shift? Probably not, but any hotel employee knows that midnight shifts are as weird as they get. Would rebellious staff members assemble a mock wedding at a guest's request? Highly unlikely, but I've been asked by a guest for stranger favors. Would hotel staff and guests have fraternize, flirt, and have private get-togethers? Well...yeah, I've seen that happen.HOTEL BABYLON treads a very delicate between a variety of genres. There are gut-wrenching laughs and moments that elicit small smirks. The drama can be very serious, but it's never cyncial or mean-spirited. The show is sexy, but not pornographic. The music is sometimes classy, and sometimes deliberately pop.What keeps HOTEL BABYLON captivating, however, is its truthfulness to the world it creates. The acting is very strong, the photography is incredibly stylish (Guy Ritchie - take notes!), the characters are portrayed more with conviction than mockery, the production is top-notch, and the adventures (even the crazy ones) are so well-paced and structured that you just can't help but go along for the ride.People who've worked in a hotel will appreciate the outlandish circumstances this staff can be put in, and how ridiculously dedicated and knowledgable the staff are required to be. And if you've never worked in a hotel before...after HOTEL BABYLON, you'll appreciate the guest services provided and definitely be a better sport on your next vacation. Cheers!Give HOTEL BABYLON a peek. Considering my favorite shows are darker ones like THE WIRE and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, this BBC gem along with the new DOCTOR WHO is a pleasant surprise.

review/summary: Hotel Babyon - 5 Stars
review/text: I discovered BBC programming after watching the excellent comedy series "Coupling" late one night on PBS. And I must say, the British have some outstanding shows."Hotel Babylon" is easily one of hippest, sexiest shows in recent memory -- miles ahead of NBC's "Las Vegas". Of course much of that can be contributed to the sharp writing and attractive cast, as well as the sleek sets and gorgeous shots of London.Still, there's a lot more to this series than meets the eye. Newly appointed deputy manager Charlie Edwards (Max Beesley) serves as the series' narrator, navigating the trials and tribulations that the staff of the five-star property meet each day.Above Max is Rebecca Mitchell (Tamzin Outhwaite), the Hotel's general manager. She's a gorgeous, confident woman who handles everything from "ordinary guests" to rock stars and even foreign delegates. Though highly poised on the outside, she's hiding a number of secrets that are revealed as the series progresses -- among them the fact that she's left her husband and is currently living inside the hotel itself.The supporting cast is as diverse as it is amusing. Guest concierge Tony Casemore (Dexter Fletcher) does everything from getting theater tickets and restaurant tables, to high-class prostitutes for the rock stars who inevitably arrive from time to time. Joining him at the front desk area is receptionist Anna Thorton-Wilton (Emma Pierson), an old flame of Charle's and a rather superficial social climber."Hotel Babylon" alternates between the day-to-day grind of the hotel business to the persona lives of the characters. All of them seem to have secrets of some kind -- ones that eventually rear their ugly heads on the job. Of course, there's also a good dose of sex, glamor and money, all of which make the series a pleasure to watch!

review/summary: Awesomely Fun!!!
review/text: It took me about an episode and a half to fully be able to appreciate everything this show has to offer. The pacing is very well done. There is not a lot of downtime before character development begins automatically drawing you into the world that the characters inhabit. You immediately know which characters you are going to love and which ones you are going to love to hate. Working in the hotel industry myself in New York City I really enjoy seeing the characters go through the same trials and tribulations of the glitzy and glamorous world of it all if not a little more exaggerated and exciting. I particularly enjoyed the 6th episode with the crazy and eerie overnight shift. All in all I think that after reading the book this is about as perfect a representation of the material as can be made. I recommend the book and the series to anyone that works in a hotel or has ever stayed in a hotel. You will appreciate every episode for at least one of the subplots if not all of them. My only criticism is that the major story arcs that carry over from episode to episode develop a little slowly, but the payoff makes it all worthwhile. One more thing that I really enjoy is the soundtrack. It seems like the entire show is underscored with very nice music to help maintain the mood and create a perfect atmosphere to absorb you into every scene.

review/summary: Great British Show ... Bad Sound
review/text: This is a show about a posh hotel ... and it has enough scandal, sex and drama to satisfy any fan of British television. You'll need a region 2 DVD player to watch this. But those are easy and inexpensive enough to find. One of my favorite shows ever is Footballers Wives and although this show doesn't live up to that benchmark it still sizzles.One caveat is that the sound mixer for this show should be ashamed at themselves. The speaking track is low and muffled in many cases. The music track is booming and loud. It gets annoying because especially for an American viewer, it is hard to understand about a quarter of what is being said anytime there is music playing while characters are speaking. (which is almost always) This is one of the most poorly mixed shows I have ever heard in terms of the audio ... it is almost like someone made this on a laptop. The audio engineer really screwed this up. It makes the show very hard to watch because extremely hard to understand certain characters, especially when things are spoken in hushed tones or whispers. They put music (loungy heavy bass music behind the showe almost always.Beyond the terribly destructive audio, the show is interesting. The characters are ones you can invest in. A witchy manager, a slick assistant manager with a troubled and mysterious past, a lothario bartender, sexy cleaning lady, old school doorman, conniving ex-girlfriend front desk manager and a capable but somewhat shady concierge who steals the show. The guests who check into the hotel pose certain problems ... rockstars, suicidal guests, high class call girls. Each show usually focuses on 2 or 3 of these guests and their problems along with the drama between the staff. It is a good balance of humor and drama and each show is a nice escape where you can get involved in the plotlines and characters without suspending too much disbelief.The resolutions of the episode ... how they wrap up the storyline ... is usually pretty predictable and too cutesy. But this is a small part of the show. I made it through the first season and enjoyed it but to be honest, I don't know how many seasons I could invest myself in watching the same environment. Also, British luxury hotels are a lot different than luxury hotels in the USA. I can't help but think when I watch this how gaudy and cheap the hotel looks. It is supposed to be a creme de la creme top of the line luxury hotel ... however, here in the USA it looks sort of seedy and tawdry and not at all luxurious. Think lots of neon, grey and red. I think the set design does the show a dis-service ... but then again, I've stayed at a few hotels in the British style that were very expensive and very tawdry looking.Overall, a good show with interesting characters and sort of interesting storylines. I don't know how many seasons I could watch this ... but I guess Bad Girls focused on a prison and made it to 7 or 8 seasons. So we will see. Another good British drama with sexy story lines and plenty of plot twists. Anyone who can give me some recommendations on more British soap style dramas like this would be very helpful. I have seen all the Footballers Wives and Bad Girls. I am thinking my next show might be Mile High ... but would love a Brisith tv show in the veign of FBW. This is as close as I've come so far.

review/text: I've watched this before and I come back to it often enough that I felt that owning it was worthwhile - watching it is like having a drink while listening to smooth jazz (if that's your thing) or some really decadent dark chocolate in front of a fire (if that's your thing)...there's something delicious in the way the characters handle all the (sometimes touching, sometimes silly, sometimes suspenseful) situations, so smoothly, handling guests in such a way that they don't know they're being handled. I aspire to deal with office politics and ruffled customers the way the staff of Hotel Babylon do!

review/summary: Fun Series
review/text: I just finished watching the last episode of series 1 of the Hotel Babylon program. For the most part, since there are some serious happenings sometimes, this is a fun series to watch. Lots of funny and naughty things going on.The hotel manager, of the five star Hotel Babylon of London, has husband trouble and you find out why in the last episode of series 1. Her assistant has a dark past, but he seems to be overcoming it well. The concierge is a real sharp character. Front desk staff are very amusing. The bartender (Gino) is a very funny Italian guy. Housekeeping is run by a lady that has more than an eye on the assistant manager. Other staff provide good moments as well too.Guests come in all shapes, sizes and "eccentricities". The guy in drag in the first episode was something else. The honeymoon couple who encounter a rat(supplied by staff) are not to be missed, as are many others as the episodes progress.In the last episode of this series, the assistant manager is shot, but he is still alive at least when the episode comes to an end. Guess viewers will have to see series 2 to see how that works out.This is a British series so be ready for edgy humor at times and some great fun as well. They throw in some serious stuff once in a while for good balance.I am looking forward to series 2. I say give it a try!

review/summary: Good trashy fun...most of the time
review/text: I'm watching this series on Netflix while home sick with bronchitis. For the most part, I've enjoyed it a very great deal. The show provides a glimpse into a fictional five star hotel in London, which is a world that I'll never see behind from the perspective of an insider and probably won't see any time soon as a guest. While some of the capers and scams the staff and guests get up to seem a bit exaggerated for dramatic purposes, a lot of the stories do have some factual basis I'm sure."Hotel Babylon" seems to me to be a sort of combination of the much more inferior (and wholesome) "Love Boat" (with the regular cast being "the crew" interacting with various passengers and their storylines) and the superior British series "Hustle" (about goodhearted British con artists). Stylistically, the series uses a lot of the same tricks that "Hustle" does (sped up action and other visual stunts).The cast is superior and unlike some I actually like the character of Anna (maybe because she's so pretty and has that sexy British upper class accent). The standout characters are Charlie, the super-concierge, and Max, the hotel manager.The plots are fun most of the time with one of the best being when an all star British soccer team visitsThe only major negative I would give the show is when they decide to have a plot that sends a sometimes overwrought political message:1. a preachy episode plot about illegal aliens featuring a heartless immigration inspector2. an episode plot featuring a Bosnian Serb war criminal whose resolution has the cast arguably colluding in a kidnapping and probably murder3. an episode plot that decries child labor in the fashion industryAnother fault is that the characters lie to each other an awful lot and I think that would pretty much erode trust and friendships.But overall, I'd say that if you can suspend disbelief some, it's worth "checking into" Hotel Babylon for a little fun. Just remember "What goes in Hotel Babylon, stays in Hotel Babylon."

review/summary: Is this great TV??? You bet it is
review/text: Hotel Babylon is not just good TV...it's great TV!!!! The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite (formerly of EastEnders, a BBC soap) and Max Beesley (from the ill-fated movie "Glitter" starring Mariah Carey). The show could make for a great drama series, but I felt that it is a mix of a drama, comedy, and soap opera all mixed into a great BBC show. The show aired on BBC America for a while but didn't get around to seeing it. I can now say that I got the DVD set and all the episodes are great. The season finale was an interesting to watch.The show reminds me of Hotel which aired on ABC from 1983 to 1988. The reason...Hotel was set at a fictional San Francisco hotel as Hotel Babylon was set at a luxury five-star hotel in England.I recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the BBC.

The coolest thing about this series is that it is something that my fiance and I are heavily addicted to. The drama is quite intense and very entertaining. The one thing that kind of irked me was that Charlie was not as tough or outspoken as I would have liked. He was great with the guests but in regards to the staff and his boss he was a bit too reserved for me. I highly recommend this series and can't wait to see what happens in Season 2

review/summary: Grand Hotel it ain't
review/text: And I thought only Hollywood could produce such self-conscious, unfunny, witless television.Handsome Max Beesley was delightful in Tom Jones, but his career, aside from the big money, has taken a real nose-dive with this series. Likewise, Dexter Fletcher saw much better days with Guy Ritchie. Except for the 'hard-nosed business woman', the women are self-serving bimbos that Las Vegas would be proud of, but all the characters are monochromatic and shameless stereotypes: unctuous Italian, gay black, trampy receptionist. The latter is also a consummate, if failed (due to stupidity), gold-digger who regularly sleeps with any good-looking guest who's rich enough. In fact, the whole place is run like a high-class brothel.These people supposedly work is a 5-star hotel in London, but their every action belies the 'invisible service' that one might expect in such an establishment. Week after week they bully, preach to, invade the privacy of, and otherwise interfere with the lives of high-toned clients. No one ever gets fired, no matter how egregious and selfish their behavior. It can be said that the characters and scripts display all the emotional maturity, and depth, of a ten year old. The episode in which the cliched straight Italian barman affects being gay (taught by the token gay black desk clerk) in order to get a big tip from a gay guest, is both embarrassing and offensive.Other reviewers find this series addictive. I, too, must admit that I watched the whole first series on a popular streaming service, but mostly in order to see if they could maintain such high standards of superficiality and questionable moral tone throughout. They did.At least I didn't suffer the humiliation of paying for it.

If tracks that come from nowhere, do nothing and go nowhere are your thing, stick to T Dream and Edgar's current releases. If you like the opposite and the Dream Mixes groove of electronics, guitars and upbeat tracks then Neptunes is an absolute must. It might sound a bit new agey in places at first, but stick with it and after a few plays you'll be hooked. Track 10 - Murder Mystery Dinner Train - is probably the highlight.

review/summary: Very promising d&eacute;but solo album
review/text: With this 2005 d&eacute;but solo album, "Neptunes", 35-year old Jerome Froese has finally severed the reins and moved away from the familial music-making of Tangerine Dream to strike out on his own. And a very impressive affair it is, too, boding well for the future of his "Guitartronica" project -- blending guitar and MIDI synthesisers and sequencers -- of which this is the first release. Although there remain traces of his TD up-bringing, particularly in the use of wordless female vocal samples and the occasional orchestral string wash, the music here offers both a heavier base and wider range of styles, textures and moods than has been evident in the output of his father's band for a good many years. Jerome's guitar-playing is more versatile and more assured, and his sense of beat finitely more secure than those of Edgar; these combine to make this a very mature album indeed.The whole production (78 minutes spread over 12 tracks) is heavily guitar- and drum-focused and very readily drops into a dance beat but is nevertheless rich and varied in texture and also offers a pleasing shift of mood and in atmosphere as it progresses. It provides many rewards for those who prefer to listen to their music rather than simply to feel (or to move to) it and this album should appeal both to a modern audience as well as to an older generation still bemoaning the disappearance of the 1980s' Tangerine Dream sound world.Highly recommended to anyone looking for something new. (And if you're looking for more like this, try the 2007 follow-up album, "Shiver Me Timbers".)

I echo the sentiments of the other reviewers here in that this album by Jerome far surpasses in quality and originality any recent Tangerine Dream releases.The album is composed of 12 impressive sonic soundscapes (though the last hardly counts as only 40 seconds long). All the tracks have a freshness and lush atmosphere that is quite appealing. its one of those albums that you listen to in entirety rather than selecting a few tracks.

review/text: I'm very happy to have in my hands one of the best CD's of this new Millennium.Back in 2005 when I heard Jerome was going to release his first solo I said: "I don't know. Lets wait and see...". I WAS WRONG.When I got my "Neptunes" CD nobody was at home that day. So, I took a time to relax, drink my orange juice with some drops of bitter almond extract and put my sound system to perform without blowing out any window.Track one. What a beautiful tack!. The best introduction for a great CD.Track two. Great!.Track three. Fantastic!.Track four. Ok, it blown-out my senses. "This track worth the whole CD", I said. But wait, there are more, a lot more.Almost 80 minutes of exquisite music. Tacks 8 and 10 are as good as tracks 4 and 1."Neptunes" reminds me the same feelings I had when I listened "Underwater Sunlight" for the first time back in 1986."Neptunes" music is something like "Mars Polaris" mixed with "DM4" and "DM2: Timesquare".Yes, it is that good.Hats off to Jerome Froese.Eduardo Nava.

review/text: Energetic guitarwork over spacey electronic soundscapes make this the best Tangerine Dream release not by Tangerine Dream!Son of Tangerine Dream founder Edgar Froese the first solo project by Jerome Froese is far better than his father's solo projects.With the exception of the great musical pieces on Tangerine Dream's new Jean D'Arc the instrumental pieces on this album outshine most recent Tangerine Dream releases!Back in the mainstream Gwen Stefani had huge success when she made her solo album without her group No Doubt.Jerome Froese achieves that same level of success here.If you're a Tangerine Dream fan the solo releases of Edgar Froese aren't really essential.Neptunes however is essential to all Tangerine Dream fans.

review/summary: No &quot;Insider&quot; Secrets
review/text: If you are someone who is fairly new to the law school admissions process and haven't done much research on what it takes to get into law school, this information might seem very helpful and insightful to you. However, as someone who has read several other books (Richard Montauk's &quot;How To Get Into the Top Law Schools,&quot; Robert Miller's &quot;Law School Confidential&quot; and more) and done the necessary research on the internet, this book brought very little new information to the table. Perhaps the most unique thing about this book is the &quot;15 essential factors&quot;...unfortunately, many of those 15 factors--though essential--are things the average person applying to law school--particularly top law schools--doesn't care about and might cast aside even after reading this book.I do agree with her that many pre-law advisers are ill-prepared to advise pre-law students and don't know nearly as much as they should. However, if the info in this book is the information she provided other pre-law advisers with, then it's nothing that the advisers nor the students couldn't have come up with themselves or elsewhere. I still say Montauk's book is the best on law school admissions out there, regardless of what schools you're interested in. HIS book is the one with all the insider secrets in it. Wright's book is just a very broad overview of the admissions process, in my opinion.The one thing this book totally has in common with Montauk's book that is very disappointing is that they do nothing to help minorities know what the admissons process will truly be like for them or how to handle it. For that, you have to look up books by Evangeline Mitchell. Most books have a tendency to treat everyone the same, as if all the information applies to them the same, and that is deceiving.In conclusion, if you feel pretty well-informed already about admissions or are looking for an extra bit of information that might give you that edge or illuminate your particular situation...this book is not the one for you. Only if you really know very little about law school admissions might this book be worth it...but I'd still say it'd be best to go with Montauk's eye-opening admissions guide.

review/summary: Not an "ultimate guide"
review/text: Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.

review/summary: Exactly what I needed.
review/text: This book answered all my questions about getting into law school in a plain and straightforward way. It was easy to read, and clear in its explanations. It even answered many questions I hadn't even thought to ask. The stories that are included in its &quot;Tales From the Trenches&quot; are really interesting, sometimes funny, and really help you to know how to avoid mistakes you might otherwise make. It's much more help than any other source I have found. The only thing it doesn't do is have a full LSAT prep course, but it does give you examples of the questions, and tells you how you can structure your own preparation program. Buying this book actually saved me money by helping me choose only to the right law schools for me, and by giving me a way to evaluate LSAT courses.(It turns out that a lot of expensive courses are not as good as you might think!) The appendix alone is worth the cost of the book. It has information on all the law schools sorted by the &quot;15 Essential Factors&quot; for picking law schools as they are outlined in the book. It makes it easier to sort through all the schools to find the right ones to apply to. This book really gave me confidence that I will get into law school. I can't wait to get my &quot;big envelopes&quot;!

review/summary: THIS BOOK SAVED ME OVER $100,000.00!!!
review/text: Boy am I lucky to have found The Ultimate Guide to Law School Admission. I picked it up because a friend recommended it to me as being the best book for the law school application process, and was she right! When I got the book I skipped right to the chapters on the admission process and found the whole thing very informative and encouraging. It let me know that even though I'm not the best student, there are plenty of schools that I would definitly get in to, and it told me how to make my application the best it could possibly be. I am sure that I would have gotten into at least a couple of the schools I had picked to apply to. However, lucky for me, before I sent in my applications I decided to read the book again. This time I started with the first chapter &quot;Should I go to law school.&quot; Guess what? Being a lawyer isn't what I thought it was! I mean, this book told me things about what lawyers personal lives are like, and what their average work day is like... stuff that I had never gotten anywhere else! This chapter convinced me that I would not be happy being a lawyer! Not only did this chapter save me from the expensive application fees... it saved me from spending the next three years wasting my time, and tuition money, pursuing a degree that would have put me in a job that apparently isn't right for me at all! Thank you Mrs. Wright, you saved me $100,000.00! I definitly recommend that EVERYONE read this chapter first! Don't go to law school without it!!!

review/summary: Great treatment of the defeat of reticence by exposure
review/text: Using a quiet, restrained writing style that is a pure pleasure to read, Gurstein chronicles the one-sided battle between the party of exposure and the party of reticence. She is on the side of reticence and writes with the pained nostalgia of a Southerner describing aspects of the War Between the States. Guerstein knows that reticence is a lost cause; she asks only whether it should be.Gurstein makes a quiet case for the reintroduction of taste, judgement, and sensibility into our public lives. This is a common theme these days. What is uncommon is that she derives her &quot;argument&quot; (always presented with the greatest of civility) from the distortion of privacy that somehow led from Brandeis's great legal work on privacy to the transformation of social man to private men and women and eventually to the public dissemination of all sorts of private matters. This is innovative and intriguing.Reticence should emerge from the coordinated behavior of civilized persons; it should not be coerced by legislation and litigation. It is thus especially appropriate that Gurstein never hectors or lectures. Instead, she paints such a delightful alternative portrait of life, far from morning talk radio, nightly real tv, and ever-present commercial messages in nearly all media, that she inspires the reader to aspire toward at least some aspects of reticence.I felt that Gurstein did not define reticence early enough and failed to take advantage of the opportunities to add more detail as the book progressed. I assume that the party of reticence acquired useful knowledge over time, such as after its (happily) failed efforts to prosecute the publisher of Joyce's Ulysses. But these reservations are minor.My most serious concern is whether the domestic party of reticence has foreign (and sometimes not-so-foreign) counterparts in governments that have successfully enforced taste through stern rule of law. I would have appreciated a treatment of these cultural (or anti-cultural) forces. Althoug! h very difficult, such an effort would have greatly sharpened my understanding of the tenets of the party of reticence and its role in our society. Gurstein surely knows that the mere existence of such potential counterparts to her domestic party of reticence may chill further inquiry; after all, she records numerous instances in which the party of exposure has dangled straw men for talismanic protection from true debate. It would be very useful if Gurstein, accounting for the human rights of those oppressed by governmental regimes, could make a better case for the human rights of those increasingly oppressed by the party of exposure, whose methodology of oppression is vastly different. The incremental personal losses to the party of exposure do not lend themselves to the same degree of drama, but possibly, over a sufficiently long period of time, they can present, cumulatively, a meaningful loss of freedom.Henry James wrote that the words, &quot;summer afternoon&quot; were the most pleasant in the English language. Take a summer afternoon (or two) to read this euphonious essay for a refreshing breather from the cacophony of Howard Stern, Don Imus, and their local knock-offs; follow-up news stories on Viagra; Judge Judy; infomercials; network news; and the culture of money, sex, power, and fame hustled by the print and electronic media.

Glorifying God can only be done from a heart that is glad in God. Deep joy in God is the true foundation for all obedience; treasuring Him over all things is the only Christ-exalting motivation to endure suffering...especially to willfuly choose suffering.Show it to your Youth Group, Men's/Women's Group, or Home Bible Study.

review/summary: Requires too much coordination
review/text: I bought this software for my 5 year old. He has a couple of the other RH software games and he likes them a lot. This game, however, was too challenging for him. The biggest problem I see is that the game requires the child to be able to maneuver the vehicle using all 4 scroll keys on the keyboard. During one exercise, which by the way you can't get to the next level until you complete this exercise, the game requires that you use the keys to move while watching out for falling lava rocks and clouds, monitor a fuel gauge, watch arrow indicators that help you determine where objects are in the arena below, and watch a scope that shows animals when you're hovering over the top of them.I tried to perform this exercise myself and got frustrated. It's just too hard to expect even a 7 year old to complete this exercise let alone a 5 year old.There are some exercises he can complete himself but they mostly require using the left, right keys.I don't know who this game would be good for. Parts of it would be too easy for someone 7 or older. Yet some parts are too difficult for those younger than that.

review/summary: You can't pick which parts you want to play!
review/text: I got this for my 4 year old son because he really likes Rescue Heroes and it sounded like it would have some adventures for him.What the description doesn't tell you is that you can't pick which activities you want to play. You have to complete one part before you can go to the next which just doesn't make sense for this age group. There are certain parts he has no interest in or are too challenging so he gets frustrated and can't get to play the parts he does enjoy. The graphics for the different rescues are very basic and each time you go through the sequence it's exactly the same stuff, so even if he could do it I think it would get boring fast. The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is that my son has enjoyed watching it (while I play it). If you're looking for something your child can do easily by themselves without getting frustated - don't get it. Almost all of the play involves using the arrow keys instead of the mouse. If your child has no problem with the arrow keys, he might not have trouble.

review/summary: Very Frustrating
review/text: My three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts at playing it hasn't been touched since. You are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the "power-up segments" instead you are using the up-down arrows on the keyboard - too hard for him and not much fun. Very disapointed with this game and wish I could return it.

review/summary: Lava Landslide
review/text: I gave this game to my son as an early birthday present. He's almost four and loves the Rescue Heroes. The reviews I read were mixed so I decided to buy it anyway. I'm really glad I did. Sure it's challenging, but it's a good excuse for the parents to get involved. First I did the hard parts for him, to show him what needed to be done. Then I guided him through them and finally he ended up doing it all by himself. He was so proud when he accomplished the hard tasks that he couldn't do at first!Unlike most computer games this one requires the use of the arrow keys instead of the mouse. Well, it's always nice to learn new skills.I can't wait to give my son the two other RH games I baught for his birthday. I have no doubt he'll love them too.

review/summary: A must read for anyone with blood pressure issues
review/text: Books by Dr Kenneth Cooper have been a tremendous source of guidance for me for over 30 years.When I first started being affected by the stress side effects of working too hard and too long in the 70's I started exercising. At the time jogging/running was becoming quite popular, so I took that up. I like to read so I read the Jim Fixx book on running which led me to Dr Cooper's book "Aerobics" (a term he coined), then to "Aerobics Program for total Well Being...", which became sort of a bible for a long time. After retirement I quit smoking and started going to a doctor. Found to be out of shape - again - I looked up Dr Cooper and saw his book "Start Strong, Finish Strong" which I absorbed like a sponge dropped in a bucket of water. Joined a gym and started the prescription of 55% aerobics, 45% strength and have never felt better. Now I've got one doctor trying to tie me down to hypertension drugs. That diagnosis was contrary to my own readings, so I'm in the middle of a complete cardio workup. (The initial stress test results were great, waiting for the in depth analysis.) When I saw this book it was a gotta have.In this book Dr. Cooper very thoughtfully presents all factors in a very helpful manner with a goal of controlling blood pressure without medications, but points out factors that could make them necessary. After my first reading I feel like I can more intelligently discuss the stress test results with my cardiologist, then better deal with my general physician.I would hardily, strongly recommend this book for any person who has had a too high blood pressure reading.

review/summary: Real Alaskan Sourdough
review/text: Ruth Allman has written an excellent book about Alaskan sourdough history and provided very tasty receipes. As a resident of Kodiak,Alaska I have been lucky enough to get some of Ruth Allmans sourdough starter. I have tried her receipes and all I can say is , wow! San Francisco look out. You get a real sense of the struggle of the pioneers with this book, and the way she describs the receipes, you can just imagine spreading the butter and jam on the bread. My favorite receipe is the hot griddle cakes with fresh strawberries. As Ruth says, the art of mixing the batter with air, and the timing of slopping it on the grill is a skill learned over time. The Baked Alaska with sourdough waffles (which by the way is how it was actually first made) is a dessert from heaven. This is a book that every sourdough making Alaskan owns.

review/summary: Cheechako to Sourdough in 190 Pages
review/text: My poor dogeared, stained copy of this book came to me by way of my dad and brother after their trip to Alaska in 1989. Dad acquired some starter in about 1959 that its guardian said had been going since the days of the 49ers. I know it's been bubbling since then. All Dad made, though, were bread and rubbery pancakes. He, unfortunately, didn't buy a copy for himself, although I'd give anything to have him make another meal of them! You see, that's the magic of sourdough, the romance, the stories, the memories! I've not yet been to Alaska, but Ruth Allman has taken me from Cheechako to Sourdough by generously sharing her recipes and her stories with me. I read this book just for the enjoyment of it sometimes. We had her waffles this morning. I made her Flower Rolls recipe into Danish rolls for my famously fussy father-in-law. What better tribute could I make to this cook and her book than to say that he loved them! My two year old son and I will make a little fire in the woods and bake a sourdough version of bannock in Dad's old Dutch oven this week and make some memories of our own.

It was bubbling away the next morning and I can't wait to try it in a few more days...The directions in this book are simple to follow. The anecdotes and history provided are entertaining. The recipes all sound delicious! I'll be working my way through many of these, starting of course with the sourdough hotcakes and bread. The handwritten format just adds to the charm of the book.

review/summary: Cannot recommend
review/text: As a former Alaskan, I didn't want to have to do this. But after repeatedly attempting Allman's recipes and having to throw out 8-10 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time--and then comparing to Ed Wood's recipes which work flawlessly, and Lisa Rayner's very excellent Wild Bread: Hand-baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen, I can't help but notice that their recipes work, where Allman's fail.I'm not a novice baker. The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe, but that can be found other places as well.If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it, I recommend any of Ed Wood's books, even his very old ones. Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread. But pass on this book.While some of the historical vignettes were interesting--not enough so to warrant the cost of the book. Check it out at your library if you must.

review/summary: The best sourdough book around
review/text: For those of us who would prefer to use sourdough starter as the sole leavening agent in making breads, this cookbook is very helpful in getting us "started". There are some receipts calling for the addition of yeast, and baking soda is often added not so much to leaven loaves as to create a chemical change which dampens some of the sourness in a very sour pot of starter. Overall, this book gives some of the best history of sourdough from a lady who knows first-hand the importance of an active sourdough starter, and will get any beginner started off making some very good breads, rolls, breakfast items & desserts. There is even a section at the end for making various products from the wild berries grown in the Last Frontier (for those of us who are able to utilize lingonberries & such)! Even for those who don't care to do a lot of baking, this book has a great deal of interesting information about Alaska & its pioneers - a great read for celebrating our 50th year of Statehood!

review/summary: A Bit of Heaven
review/text: I got this book because of all the interesting stories and sourdough tidbits that it contained. The stories were informative, a fascinating look at history, and most of all - FUN! Then, because she made it sound so easy and delectable - I decided to try making sourdough and see what would happen. I had to go back and forth in the book a little to make sure I was doing everything correctly - the Sourdough Hints in the back were very helpful. Well, it's been a week since I mixed up the starter. The sourdough smelled "sour cream sour" and it looked OK. (I was glad not to see little black fungus or other such nasties growing on the surface like the last sourdough I tried to make 20 years ago). So I made the Quick Sourdough Bread today. I figured that was a good place to start since I didn't want to take time for the 2 risings that the regular Sourdough Bread recipe called for. It rose nicely in the pan. It smelled good. But I did take it out of the oven 10 minutes early, because it was a deep golden brown and I was afraid it would be a rock-hard loaf if I waited the full 45 minutes. I brushed butter on the crust to soften it a little (still paranoid about the possible hard crust) and waited for it to cool. I sliced it. My husband and I had one slice. Then we had another. (And, yes, then we had one more with black cherry jam!) Oh My Goodness!! I haven't had bread that tasted that good in a LONG time!! My husband put it this way, "It is a slice of Heaven!". I agreed wholeheartedly - better than candy, cake or cookies! So take it from a person who has hundreds of cook books and probably thousands of recipes and has cooked all sorts of bread for the last 30+ years - this book is worth getting. It made the best bread we have ever eaten and now I can't wait to try some of the other recipes in the book. Four thumbs up.

review/summary: Imprecise Recipes Make Bad Bread
review/text: It's quaint, I'll give it that. The handwritten style and illustrations are reminiscent of, perhaps, an early scratch draft of "The Moosewood" done with a sharpie instead of a nib and ink. But the recipes for bread are poorly assembled.Any bread maker knows how the proportionality of ingredients is key for bread. I've tried two of the four bread recipes so far and neither have performed well. One recipe calls for 8 to 10 cups of flour, which I halved, and so attempted 4 to 5 cups. At 3 cups, my dough was full. Okay, yes, great variety of atmospheres and starter consistency, yes, but the next recipe was like that too. And my sponge has not raised a mm in 24 hours. Perhaps it's too cold in my kitchen? Nevertheless, don't expect this book to even hint at how long a rise will take.And what kind of sourdough calls for baking soda or commercial yeast? The kinds in this book!I'm not claiming to be an expert on bread, but I've made two loaves a week for 2 years now, with a lot of success with other cookbooks (America's Bread Book, The Bread Book, My Bread); I think this one is lame. I'm glad it's my housemate's and that I didn't pay for it.

review/text: Bought this in 1982 and used it thoroughly for years until it fell apart and was held together with rubber bands, paper clips, and clothes pins...then it got away. This book is as much fun just to read as it is to cook from. Full of Alaskan lore, great recipes, and if you are into sourdough, or think you might be, this may be the only recipe book you'll ever need for just plain family eating: breads, biscuits, hot cakes, waffles, and anecdotes.

review/summary: Enjoyed Ruth's Sourdough pancakes when she served them.
review/text: I toured the House of Wickersham in Juneau Alaska years ago. After the tour, Ruth Allman served everyone Sourdough pancakes with her Rose Hip syrup. After such a delicious treat, I bought a copy of her book. I have a 1976 first edition. It has had a lot of use and that use is showing. In a few years, I will have to get another, later edition of this book.It is the best sourdough cooking book I have, and the stories she tells of "Life on the Last Frontier" only add to the book. Her father, Judge Wickersham, was one of the first territorial judges and first territorial governors of Alaska, having served in these positions shortly after President Lincoln purchased Alaska from Russia. Ruth weaves stories her father told her, throughout her book. Ruth and her husband Jack Allman, lived many years as Alaska Pioneers, and had to survive on their sourdough pot. From those days comes many of Ruth's receipes.My only regret is that I did not have Ruth Allman autograph my copy.

review/summary: The Best Sourdough Starter for Bread & Hot Cakes
review/text: I had an excellent sourdough starter from a friend in Alaska. Debbie lived on the 49 Mile River. During the winter they, Debbie & Brad made bent wood furinture to sell in a general store in Dawson. Then pan for gold in the summer. Sourdough bread & hot cakes was a staple of life for them living in such a remote location.Ruth Allman's, "Alaska Sourdough" cook book is an excellent primer in making a sourdough "starter" from scratch,(just in case you can't get a start from a friend) the proper care for your starter, and how to rejuveniate the starter when needed. We are very selective who we share our sourdough bread & rolls with. We don't want to be depended upon to provide bakery items all the time.We made our purchase from redtree15 on Amazon Marketplace. We really appreciate the service provided.

review/summary: Not your quick refrence cookbook
review/text: After having a chance to read through the book I am not sure I would have bothered purchasing it in a store. The "sourdough lore" is very interesting but in order to make the book seem more "authentically old" the author has hand-written each and every page. That's right, the only thing typed in this book is the copyright info. Her handwriting is more or less legible but it's much more difficult to read at a glance and the frequent misspellings bother me. The instructions also assume that you already know how to do a lot of things. For example, on the recipe for doughnuts it says to mix the ingredients, allow to rise, and the deep fry the cut doughnuts. I have to cut doughnuts? Is there anything I do to them first? I don't know, because none of that is included in the recipe. Also, there is no master index.Finally, all the recipes I have gone through are scaled to make massive portions. There is no eating for two out of this cookbook and you can't cut them down because they call for an odd number of eggs. Example - the pancake recipe will make about 15-20 medium sized pancakes (and calls for two cups of sourdough starter - not workable for people who don't have huge batches of starter) yet calls for only 1 egg.UPDATE: After working with this cookbook more, I wish I could have given it a lower review. It's not really a cookbook as there are probably only about 5 unique recipes. Everything else is a VARIATION that she calls a new recipe. And some of her suggestions are just plain gross. Corned beef and Worcestershire pancakes? Cottage cheese and smoked fish pancake roll ups? Ick! There are about 10,000 things she recommends doing with waffles but these are not unique recipes - these are tips, hints, and VARIATIONS. Cover waffles with ice cream, meringue, pancakes, ham, make them a sandwich, cook them with curry and dip them in fish paste. YUCKO!

There are so many great stories that even without the recipes it would be a great book. I love the muffins, they don't taste like sourdough at all! I will say that if you don't know how to bake bread you should get another book along with it. I would recommend "Beard on Bread." Don't trust him for sourdough, he dose not like it. His recipe for sourdough calls for milk with Ruth Allman says causes spoilage.

review/summary: Sourdough...Alaska style
review/text: Frankly, "Alaska Sourdough" will not suit everyone's tastes. Don't get me wrong, "Alaska Sourdough" is as much interesting from an historical standpoint as it is for the unique recipes derived from "on the trail" sourdoughs who purportedly derived these concoctions over many, many years of preserving their stock of sourdough. One gets the feeling that sourdough was the lifeblood--the sustaining force--that kept many of Alaska's intrepid miners and inevitable shysters alive when all other earthly endeavors and pleasures had evaporated.The unique uses for sourdough (makes a wonderful glue, did you know?) keeps the book moving forward, and the recipes can be a bit bizarre, especially the numerous uses of mixing clams in pancake and muffin recipes. If you're looking for more practical recipes, Ruth Allman includes those as well in what appears to be a handwritten book, simulating the feel of recipes jotted down on note cards or loose pieces of paper. The section on waffles and pancakes I found to be very useful; however, the section on creating basic sourdough bread seemed to be laborious compared to the many no-knead methods other sourdough experts espouse. A good sourdough starter is its own leavening agent, creating a dough that will rise on its own. Allman's recipes frequently encourage the use of baking soda, baking powder, and even commercial yeast to speed up the respective recipe processes. This concept might not set too well with traditional sourdough bakers."Alaska Sourdough" does not take too long to peruse. After doing so, I did a little research on Ruth Allman and her husband and found their influence to be substantial in the Juneau, Alaska community in the early 20th Century. I would encourage anyone who found the historical aspect of "Alaska Sourdough" to be compelling to look into the House of Wickersham and Ruth Allman's interesting involvement in its development and perpetuation.

Now, if I can just figure out the quirks of baking and keeping a good sourdough "growing" on my salmon troller...If you love great sourdough, give this a try...

review/summary: A "Treasury" is the Right Word.
review/text: I was happy to discover that these recordings have just been re-released, because my old vinyl copy of the theater songs has seen better days. I was very pleased to see that this re-issue now includes transliterated lyrics and English translations, which were missing from the version I had, and which are a tremendous help to language students. (I was sorry to see they had omitted "Got Fun Avrohom" from the collection, though, because it's one I've always loved -- but I still have it on the vinyl.)I agree this collection is a treasury, both in the sense that these beloved songs are treasures, but also in the sense that they are preserved here now and protected for posterity. Many nearsighted people don't care that the Yiddish culture that once thrived in Eastern Europe before the war is on the brink of disappearing forever.With only a few Yiddish-speaking enclaves left now, in cities like Winnipeg, Montreal, and New York City, the vibrant cultural heritage that these songs embody may become extinct within our lifetimes, or perhaps those of our children. And the world will be much the poorer.

review/summary: Robert Kane's *The Oxford Handbook on Free Will*
review/text: Do you want to brought up to speed on the state of the art in philosophical discussions of free will? Do you want to give yourself a top-flight graduate course on this exciting philosophical topic? Then read Robert Kane's The Oxford Handbook on Free Will. This book might be the single best book to study if one wants a comprehensive overview of most of the controversies unfolding in debates about free will and moral responsibility. The essays are all outstanding. Each is penned by one of the leading figures in the field, and each combines an effort to teach at a very advanced level with a novel contribution to the literature pitched from the perspective of the author. For example, in the section devoted to compatibilism (the view that free will and moral responsibility are compatible with determinism), Kane includes four essays, one by Bernard Berofsky, another by Ishtiyaque Haji, a third by Paul Russell, and a forth by Daniel Dennett and Christopher Taylor. Each essay is detailed, crisp, completely informed, and clear as a bell. Each also advances the author's own views. Reading through this section, one can learn exactly what is now taking place in the arena of compatibilism. The same can be said about the section devoted to libertarianism (the thesis that some persons act from a sort of free will that requires the falsity of determinism). In this section, Kane includes probably the four finest philosophers currently defending this topic, Tim O'Connor, Randy Clarke, Carl Ginet, and Kane himself.In all, there are eight sections to Kane's collection with a total of 25 essays. The sections are devoted to the following topics: 1) theological issues as they pertain to free will, 2) theories of physics and the free will problem, 3) the consequence argument (a highly influential argument for the thesis that determinism is incompatible with the ability to do otherwise), 4) compatibilism, 5) the relevance of alternative possibilities for moral responsibility (some philosophers think that the freedom to act otherwise is not required for moral responsibility), 6) libertarian views, 7) non-standard views about the relationship between free will, moral responsibility and determinism (such as the view that no one has free will or moral responsibility regardless of the truth or falsity of determinism), and finally, 8) neuroscientific influences on our understanding of the free will topic. An impressive range of topics indeed.I have been publishing and writing on the topics of free will and moral responsibility for over 10 years now and I simply know of no single collection that even approximates the impressive quality and breadth of Kane's handbook. It is an outstanding book.

review/summary: Oxford and Kane have done it again!
review/text: So far forth, the editors of the Oxford Handbook series have managed to put together products which both the neophyte and the fully-informed scholar will find beneficial. Robert Kane has certainly done his part to keep up the trend.All of the essays in this volume are written by philosophers who have made significant individual contributions to the contemporary discussion about human freedom. Most of the authors have also produced influential works in related fields (philosophy of mind, action theory and moral psychology), and many of them are thoroughly conversant with the relevant empirical research in physics and neuroscience. Indeed, parts II and VIII of the book are dedicated, respectively, to the interplay between the problems of free will and quantum physics/chaos theory on the one hand, and recent work in neuroscience on the other. The result is a compilation of essays written with the sort of texture and philosophical sensitivity that repays careful (re-)reading, and brimming with suggestive ideas that could well move the debate into some relatively unexplored terrain. (We should expect nothing less from a volume edited by Kane, who has himself long advocated the importance of approaching the ancient problem of free will from novel directions.) What's more, the collection includes essays from several philosophers whose own books on free will are, though quite important and valuable, somewhat cost prohibitive. (Anyone living on a graduate student's salary who's tried to pick up a copy of Pereboom's or Clarke's or Double's or Strawson's books will know what I mean.) So the expense of the present volume is, when seen in that light, thoroughly justifiable. In fact it's a steal! Or so I've tried to convince my wife.Finally, with his characteristic combination of clarity and rigor, Kane provides a lengthy introduction to the book that will help both the professional philosopher and the new-comer find their bearings in this complex debate with as little intellectual turmoil as can reasonably be hoped for. The book is a good one, highly recommended.

review/summary: Kane's Compilation Will Leave You Proud To Lose An Argument
review/text: I first encountered Bob Kane's skill with the daedal discipline of free will in his book *The Significance of Free Will.* At that time, I realized that Kane had an almost suspicious talent for articulating my own objections, and then articulating a response that would often satisfy me more than my own.While such a talent may be a bit threatening for readers aiming to claim their own victories, Kane's affability and enthusiasm always leave the reader not only with the necessary knowledge, but with a sense of pride in having participated in his well-authenticated jaunts.This work, in particular, highlights Kane's skills as both an original author and an editor with an honest eye for the best arguments of his opponents. It will certainly become a staple, if it has not already, for professional scholars of free will and curious by-standers alike. The *Oxford Handbook of Free Will* draws together balanced selections from the most relevant authors in the field, and-despite its depth-manages to cover a range broad enough that the book would be equally well placed on the shelves of theologians, philosophers, and physicians.My main criticism is that the compilation elides some selections that, to me, seem indispensable. Then again, such a problem *should* be inevitable for a field as factious as free will, and is blunted by Kane's need to balance his equations.The Oxford group has again demonstrated their wisdom in selecting Kane as the editor of this volume. Compared to its competitors in the prosy pantheon of free-will texts, this selection will leave you energized to gnaw through the next puzzle (rather than feeling deflated by the fact that there remain more arguments to be broached).-Christian P. Erickson, M.D.christianerickson@alumni.duke.edu

review/summary: Good TV for the price - MORONIC remote
review/text: I purchased my 6620LDG, like other reviewers, to replace my old kitchen TV. I really wanted an LCD with a built-in DVD player. While I like the TV just fine, the remote is another story. I actually wrote to the manufacturer about the remote and gave them quite an earful. Included in my e.mail was the following:"While I find the overall TV to be good, I am appalled at thequality and functionality of the remote that operates and comes withthat particular model. I simply can't believe that a name brand likeSylvania would provide such a poorly designed remote to accompany ahigher-end TV.""...this remote is very uncomfortableto hold and operate. It is as if your designers made no accommodationsfor how people hold remotes, and what makes them comfortable.""Seriously. I cantt imagine who designed the actual size and shape of that remote or which idiot approved it's public distribution, but the entire lot of them need to find other professions if they think that this remote is at all acceptable.""A remote should be, at the very least,functional and comfortable enough to go unnoticed, dont you think???? Aside from the horrid shape, size and weight of the remote, this remote has an absolutely terrible layout and lacks some of the most basic buttons that come with the cheapest of remotes. I was shocked and horrified to realize that this hideous remote had no "last channel" button. Are your designers living in the 70s or do they just have their heads up their butts?""I havent had a TV remote in my hand without a last channel button in at LEAST 20 years. Since the remote is so huge, how could it not have one of the most traditional buttons on it? I consider the very lowest and feature-less remotes to be those in hotel rooms. They look like top-of-the-line models when compared to this piece of crap.On top of not having the basic buttons, and amongst other issues, the remote is frustrating because: 1. The text is illegible, 2. The buttons are laid out in a way that doesnt make sense and 3. When you channel surf, the remote is so slow to change the channel that you want to throw it on the floor and stomp on it. In fact, if I can find a universal remote that works with this TV; I intend to do just that. Of course, to add insult to injury, it states clearly in your owners manual that 'We do not recommend the use ofuniversal remote controls. Not all of the functions may be controlledwith a universal remote control.' Great, so you provide a bottom of thebarrel remote with your TV, but then dont allow your customers to get adecent remote by making your TV uncooperative with them. This is thefirst time that I have encountered this too, BTW."Finally:"I hope that you promptly change the remote that comes with the 6620LDG LCD TV/DVD combo TV. I expect that you will experience many returns of this product due to the crappy remote that comes with it."THIS was their entire response:"Thank you for taking the time to express your concerns regarding our product. Your comments and opinions are important to us. Please understand that it is our objective to provide the best possible product. We hope you accept our apologies for the inconvenience you have experienced with our product."I am on the verge of taking this back because of the remote.

review/text: I compared a few different flat panels with review before I narrowed down my pick, which ended up with the Sylvania as over well liked. The picture got great reviews which yes it does have a good picture to look at but there are other important qualities you enjoy that makes viewing tv all the better. For example: sound... how was that forgotten?In this flat panel, it was. What a disappointment. If this is consider stereo than why does it sound like its coming from a tin can with no base at all. Then too boot, if you play the dvd, the sound drops and you have to really turn up the volume to hear.I want the whole package deal: space saving, great picture, and good sound. I want to enjoy the whole experience of watching and listening. How about you?

They gave me an RMA number right away, Fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later. This one is just fine. I really love the clarity of the picture. My only complaint is that in DVD mode, the sound isn't loud enough. I have it in my RV and with the A/C running, I can barely hear it. I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system. It's very lightweight and easy to move around and store. A bonus for the RV. The remote isn't great, but it works just fine and the video/audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player. All in all, it's a great deal for the price.

review/summary: A great comeback effort
review/text: This was Red's comeback album after being off the jazz scene for over a dozen years, thanks mainly to a severe drug addiction, though other health problems contributed (bad teeth and a stroke in 1972). His chops were not back yet and he knew it, and it shows to a certain extent on this CD. But there is also some great stuff here.For one thing he is not afraid to be ambitious and except for his frequent employment of the mute (which I think he uses to hide the fact that his open tone, which later became as ringing and bell-like as it had been in the '50s, wasn't back yet), he is on the attack. Tempos are up and his playing fiery. This is especially true on DONNA LEE and 52nd STREET THEME, classic bop tunes that demand precision and energy. Alto sax man Charles McPherson is a good foil for Red and plays well throughout. The rhythm section is solid and probably the steadiest player on the date is pianist Barry Harris: he is the perfect anchor for the date. Considering the circumstances, especially the effects from the stroke the year before, Red overcomes the adversity and had every right to be proud of this album. Hopefully, he was.

Rick's books are excellent for more in-depth visits, but this is great for first-timers trying to figure it all out.

review/summary: Europe Eyewitness Travel Guide by Dan Colwell
review/text: This book was an excellent buy. I recently had a holiday in Europe and it never left my side. It is packed with information, pictures and maps and in fact people travelling with me kept borrowing it all the time and were going to buy it when they got home because it had all the information they wanted to show family and friends as to where they had been and what they had seen. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Disappointed Romanian!
review/text: This book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of Europe that is "clean and proper" and fails to shed light on the rest of it. I can understand that these are "tourist guides" and why would anyone want to tour a country forgotten by time. However, I am a very disappointed Romanian with this book and would never use it as my reference. I have seen travel guides outlining Europe exclude Romania before, but with the precision and detail of DK's series, I was left yet again in disappointment.

review/summary: The Travelers Companion
review/text: I admit it: I'm addicted to travel. My wife and I are semi-retired and we are on the go half the year. We travel for our home-based business, "The Nurses Choice" which cover 50 metro areas and therefore must visit a variety of cities. We then decided to expand overseas.Having to plan for a trip to Europe, we searched for a guide that would provide what we needed. The "Eyewitness Travel Guides" offered a total package. Good maps, photos, recommended places to see, dine, and stay. It's well-organized and relatively small. We brought it on the tours of France and Italy. It served us well, allowing us to find and decide what to see fairly readily. A friend just borrowed it and they said the same thing. It really aided their decisions and provided a reliable course of action. We plan to buy the other series for other locations. That should speak for itself.

review/text: The Dk Travel guides are the best travel guides produced, each one a high quality illustrated encyclopedia on the country or city it represents. They are invaluable guides. The only disadvantage is that they are a bit on the heavy side, but the quality of printing and extensive range of color photos offsets that.

review/summary: A Superlative Planning Aide and Top-level Guide
review/text: This book was tailor made for our trip, which was for 3 weeks, hitting 8 major cities. It was useful for planning as well as a take-along guide. We traveled by train, and the book was great for "getting our heads in the game" for the next stop. The pictures are rich with detail, including cut-away views of many historical structures like castles and cathedrals. The historical synoptic narratives are extremely well written, delivering maximum information in the space available. The quality of the paper is impeccable, with a glossy finish and gorgeous colors.My 13-year old daughter, unexpectedly and unprompted, devoured the book during the train rides. She set aside her DVD player and forty or so movies, and focused on the book - day, after day, after day. She never watched a movie on the trains. When she finished studying the section on our next city, she moved outward in the book to other features of the country. She would go back and forth between the various city descriptions, the country maps, and the map of Europe. We would go into museums, and she would point out pictures she had seen in the book. Eventually, she had carefully looked over every page of the book and read far more than just what was relevant to our destinations. She probably reread the section on Anne Frank 10 times, even though we didn't get to Amsterdam and she has already read two books on the subject. Tomorrow morning, a Saturday with me off work, she and I are going to sit down together and go through the book, tabbing the sections that cover places we went. At the expense of sounding schmaltzy, I expect it will be a sentimental keepsake for the rest of her life.This is a great book for early planning, especially if you haven't decided on which cities to visit. On the other hand, if you've already made up your mind and you are visiting fewer than four cities, this is probably not the book for you - you wouldn't buy an encyclopedia if you only wanted to read three articles. Buying the book early can give you time to buy a more focused book for cities where you find you need more information.The binding on the book will appear somewhat unusual if you're unfamiliar with this publisher as I was. Sitting on a bookshelf, it looks like a hardbound book in a colorful dust jacket, even though there is no removable jacket at all. In fact, it is sort of a hybrid between a paperback and a hardbound book. The cover is actually vinyl: solid but flexible and looks and feels almost like it is plastic coated. The cover extends above and below the pages like a hard cover. One negative is that it is fairly heavy for a relatively small book. This is because of the 800, full-color, glossy pages in a book that is less than 1.25 inches thick. The other dimensions are roughly 8.5 X 5.25.I'm sorry, but I've got to take a shot at some of the negative reviews. Some criticized a lack of depth. What do you expect with 20 countries covered in 800 pages and content split between pictures, historical narrative, and touring advice that gets all the way down to restaurants and shopping? This book is a careful compromise between breadth and depth. (Our next trip will be to only three cities, and we'll buy more focused books then.) Frankly, I don't see how the publishers could have crammed more information into such a compact space. To the fellow who said the only Eastern European country covered was Czechoslovakia: (1) it's the Czech Republic, and (2) are Hungary and Poland not part of Eastern Europe? To the person who said the maps were not useful, I have to point out that maps that can actually help navigation typically can't fit on pages this small. What do you want, 200 foldout maps in an 800 page book?BTW, we brought along a set of maps that we had bought online. Surprisingly to us, we ended up mostly relying on the free ones available in the three, four, and five star hotels we stayed in. We never failed to get a good map from a hotel front desk or concierge. Even after all the preliminary study (also, my wife and I had been to most of the cities before), we often asked for suggestions on sites and several times made some new discoveries that way. We brought along a Garmin GPS, but used it very little because we were on foot, and the Garmin instructions used street names while the streets were often unmarked. (Try looking on the sides of buildings for street names.)Bottom Line: You are investing a significant amount of money, time, and sweat equity in your trip. While it isn't cheap as books go, in the greater context of trip expenses, this book is practically free. Probably the most significant cost is the weight allowance it eats up. (Put it in your carry-on; the airlines haven't started weighing those yet.) In the uses that I've described, it can significantly enhance your experience. When you get back, it will look good on your bookshelf. If you are still deciding on which cities to go to, or if you are going to more than a few cities, buy this book. You'll thank yourself, again and again, just as I thanked my wife.Bon voyage ..... buon viaggio ..... ibuen viaje ..... and, lest we forget, ..... gute fahrt!

review/summary: Good Overall Idea
review/text: I really like the eyewitness guides, I have seven including "Europe". All of them have tons of images, walking routes throught various cities, contact information for sites, hotel listings, resturants, and in many cases floor plans of museums and other buildings. I also like the fact that they give some history of the country, show images of the currancy, list suggested times to visit very busy sites and show some of the reasons why you would select to visit particular attractions.True this book does not cover all of Europe, but it does have sections on the more "popular" travel destinations. It is good if you want some general information on many different countries and to help determine which you have interest in visiting. It is not to large to carry around and has extended cover flaps to help mark the section.The last thing is that if you are traveling to only one country or going to spend a most of your time in one city, look for the individual eyewitness guides. The information in the Ireland book was better for the two week visit to Ireland, where this book (the Europe book) would have been only ok for that trip, but was perfect for the three days in Edinburgh and helping to select which countries to visit when we only had time for a few days in each.

review/summary: nice eye candy, but not as handy as the other guides
review/text: The Eyewitness Travel Guides in general provide lots of pretty pictures and are very nice, but if you want a handy, practical guide to TAKE WITH YOU on a trip you are much better off with the Rick Steves, Lonely Planet, Fodor's, or Frommer's series of travel guides. The other guides provide much better info on logistics like where to stay, where to eat, and transportation. Eyewitness (DK Publishing) makes great coffee table books, and that is what this book is. I recommend Rick Steves Best of Europe, or Lonely Planet's Europe on a Shoestring if you want a more useful guide.

review/summary: Colourful Digest Of Places To See In Europe
review/text: I bought this book to help me plan my trip to Europe and it was so useful, it was the only book I packed to take on my trip. The book covers mainly Western Europe along with Poland, Czech Republic, Hungry, and Greece. The former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia are not covered and neither are the islands of Iceland, Malta, and Cyprus. Similarly, of the "tiny" countries, only Monaco and the Vatican are mentioned; Liechtenstein, Andorra, and San Marino are not.The book describes what is available to see in Europe. For each country, about six to twenty cities/regions are discussed and for major cities (e.g. London, Paris, Amsterdam, Venice, etc.) there is more detailed coverage, such as six to twenty sights within that city along with a city map. Usually, each attraction gets about a four-paragraph write-up plus a photograph. A few major attractions (e.g. Louvre, British Museum, St. Peter's Cathedral, etc.) are devoted two to four pages plus a larger diagram. Also, each country usually has another dozen or so pages covering its history and culture as well as a discussion about practical information such as climate, banking, methods of travel, shopping, etc.The book doesn't teach you everything you need to know about Europe (e.g. nothing about foreign languages), or will want to know (e.g. hotels, restaurants, and food have modest coverage). Nor does it include everything you'll do - only places, not events, are written about (e.g. Oktoberfest only warrants a photo). But the book does an excellent job at detailing what popular, famous, interesting, or important places there are in Europe. The pictures and illustrations make the book come to life. The maps help you judge the relative positions of sights within a particular city. The descriptions are usually detailed enough so you can determine how interesting you'll find a particular place. Some people might criticize the book because it doesn't judge how "good" each sight is. However, I find this nice because everyone has different tastes and I like to have the opportunity form my own opinions.If you want to know what is available to see in Europe then this is the book for you.

review/summary: Going to Europe? Get this book!
review/text: If you're already a fan of the Eyewitness Travel Guide series, you know what to expect from this book. If this is your first time, let me tell you you'll be amazed with how great and how useful this book is.This particular guide summarizes the contents of over 20 other books by DK, including information for 20 countries in total, organized in the following way:- The British Isles (Great Britain &amp; Ireland)- France and the low countries (France, Belgium, Luxembourg &amp; The Netherlands)- The Iberian Peninsula (Spain &amp; Portugal)- Italy and Greece- Germany, Austria and Switzerland- Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark &amp; Finland)- Central and Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary &amp; Poland).This guide contains, for every country, information regarding sites to visit, hotels, restaurants, shopping, museums, travel info (how tos for travelling by train, bus, car, metro, etc). Worthy of notice are their trademark cutaways of castles and churches, maps and street-by-street graphics.The only drawback is that since it includes information on so many countries, some of it might not have the detail you'd expect. For example, the France section has only 73 pages, while the Eyewitness Travel Guide to Paris (another book from DK) has over 350 pages on Paris alone!A phenomenal guide if you're planning on visiting many countries on one trip, but if you intend to dedicate more time to just a couple, you'd be better off getting the specific country/city guides.

review/summary: The Major Sights in Twenty Countries - Amazing!
review/text: Yes, this is one heavy book. It is more than likely not a guide you want to carry around with you unless you intend to lose a few pounds from the extra weight in your backpack. Otherwise, it is quite a great guide for deciding where you want to take your next vacation in Europe. It is filled with color photography, illustrations and details you wil enjoy reading. It is graphically exciting and visually pleasing. Of all the guides I've seen, the Eyewitness Travel Guides are sheer brillance.On the inside cover there is a map of Europe and then the pages are color coded so you can find the following countries: Great Britian, Ireland, France, Belgium & Luxembourge, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.So, if you wanted to find the information on France, you just turn the book sideways and look for the yellow markings on the pages. Viola, you are there. If you are dreaming about visiting the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre or want to go see the Hall of Mirrors at the Chateau de Versailles, may I say...they are worth a plane ticket to France. Finding a bottle of Huile D' Olive in the South of France is also something you won't soon forget.There is also a guide to Europe's Rail Network and the Index is perfect.After you look through the main spots to visit in each country, there is a section filled with practical information: Visa Requirements and customs, tourist information, personal security issues, climate, banking, communications, directory for embassies, travel information like car rental and buses, etc. Then there is a shopping and entertainment. So where do you want to stay? There is a guide giving the hotel ratings and it is divided up by the areas you might enjoy visiting. Then, there is a guide to places to eat. While finding a restaurant just by exploring can be exciting, there is something to be said for a guide. Unless of course you happen to be traveling with someone who knows the country and I can imagine that is the best way to travel. Is there a lonely Frenchman out there who wants to show me Paris? SighJust kidding, but hey, a fantasy is a fantasy.So, think of this guide as an overview and then you can select an Eyewitness Travel Guide for the specific countries of interest. They are all excellent although on a first trip to Europe, I'd advice a guided tour so you can enjoy your trip instead of worrying about language barriers, etc.If you go to Paris, take a tour because I would not drive there if you paid me a million bucks! The highways in Germany are also equally terrifying. Everyone is in such a hurry to get to nowhere. If you want to enjoy your vacation without as many hassles, a tour might be the way to go. There is nothing quite like being guided through the most gorgeous cities in Europe.This guide is just the start to many adventures.~The Rebecca Review

review/text: Eyewitness travel guides are splendid and this is not an exception. This is a handy guide to Europe and shows some of the more popular spots to travel to. I was a bit confused that not all countries were included. However, that might be because they picked the places that most people travel to. I personally was a bit disapointed that Romania, Ukraine and other more far eastern european countries were not included. However, still and all, this is an awesome guide for the countries that are included. I love how they show everything instead of just writing and writing like many travel guides do. These are the best guides out there and the many photos make these guides stupendous and astounding and many leagues better then closest competitor.

review/summary: Helpful guide on tours through Europe
review/text: I recently took a backpack trip through Europe, which lasted close to a month; before heading out there I went through a few guidebooks and at that moment this one appealed the most. I cannot say if it was the presentation with the colored photographs; maps of the cities with visitor information or that I was just to plain sick of spending time searching for a guide book to take me though my journey. Nonetheless I am quite pleased that I took this guide with me. I had planned initially to visit a friend in Netherlands and spend some time scrolling through the cities; I left my guide there to my host; but off and on I would reference the book with places I visited; I must admit that this book covered all the places. Now of course I personally feel the best way to visit a place is to have some one show you around as like any other travel guide will not detail the places where the locals would head over to; like the bars, restraunts and night clubs. My visit from here lead me to Paris; it hit me with all its charm and glamour; here too I was fortunate to be taken around by friends. The real use of the guide came when I went on a solo journey to Belgium Austria and Italy. I found this guide an immense source of information. On my way to the city mostly by trains; I found the chance to orient myself and somewhat have a time frame as to how long I would stay in each city. I found that even though the book has information about hotels and hostels but at the train station's Hotel Guides; I was always able to get better deals. Pretty much I carried this heavy 800 pages book with me where ever I went.Even though this book provides immense information I would highly recommend getting additional reference books on cities, which are known, for immense sightseeing and historical attractions. One such place where the guide fell short was Florence; even tough it has considerable information and provides all the most popular sites. It literally will take a 1000 pages to detail all the places to visit; as a comparison there are over 78 places to visit which have historical importance but the book has listed only about the best 14 of them; well visiting all the places would take a few weeks of stay in comparison to a typical 3-4 days that tourists generally spend; which is sufficient time to visit the places listed in the book. Another important place not mentioned in this test was the "Museum of Arsenal" in Vienna; here on display is the car in which duke Ferdinand traveled with in Sarajevo.On the whole this covers only the most western countries of Europe and leaves a lot of East European countries and Turkey as well.

review/summary: The Quick Trip Around Europe!
review/text: This guide is great for an overview of many of the great places in Europe - but I cannot believe anyone would consider using this as their only guide. It should be used to maybe narrow down places to visit- then more comprehensive guides should be used. I have never been a believer in those 1 and 2 days in 18 cities over 3 weeks tours. 1 or 2 days is certainly not enough time to fully appreciate and get to know any city you visit. Furthermore, this guides biggest flaw is in doesn't cover anything in central/eastern europe besides the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary! Where's Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, the Baltic States, etc....? Yes, Europe is big but the countries not contained in this guide have so much to offer and certainly should not be overlooked. For example, St. Petersburg is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe - not mentioned here!Don't rush Europe - relax and enjoy it. Take time to get to know the people and cities. This guide can certainly help to narrow down Europe - but should certainly not be relied upon for extensive info on the many great places.

review/text: This is a condensed and abridged book covering most of Europe. It gives you the highlights of the countries of Western Europe. It is a good book if you planning a trip where you will spend a day or two in many places. Otherwise you should consider DK more comprehensive guides to a particular country, region or city. On the positive side the book covers several countries that DK does not have a guide for yet. On the down side, the only Eastern European countries covered are Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Also the book is heavy. Is the book worth the money? Only if you are taking a &quot;buffet&quot; tour of Europe (a little France, a little Italy, etc...).

review/summary: Great Guide to Europe!
review/text: I just returned from a two-week tour of Western Europe and this book was simply fantastic. Obviously you can't cover everything you could possibly do in Europe in 800 pages, but this book covered more than many of the other Europe tomes. I had this book and one other with me on my trip and this was the only book I opened the entire journey.The best part about this book was all of the illustrations and color photographs. This book shows you what the other guides only tell you. It's hard to tell what building your looking at if you only have a written description, but with the four color illustrations in this book things are easy to identify and find. I would recommend this book to anyone taking a trip to Europe. (Plus, when you get back from your trip this book can even help you identify all those photographs you took)

No one book could be comprehensive, and all Europe guides are pretty bulky and heavy. But the Eyewitness people have managed to fit an astonishing number of places into 800 pages - and their choices are always exactly right, especially for the first-time visitor. It can be hard to decide whether to go to Antwerp or Bruges or Brussels - if you only have time to go to one city in Belgium - and all the photographs and illustrations in this book, plus the informative descriptions, make it a lot easier to make up your mind. The maps alone, all in color, make it worth buying.

review/summary: Great when assisted by another guide
review/text: This guide is great when considering what sites and places to visit. It covers most any city you might find yourself visiting. It does a great job of describing the sites and the history behind them. Does not help with city transportation. Lightly covers the character of each city. I do enjoy the pictures and diagrams in the book. I highly recommend having another guide book that covers more logistics. I used this book along with Rick Steves Europe 2007. They were great companions to one another. My other complaint is that I am a student with a budget. This book does not cover many (if any) cheap places to eat or sleep. It does tell you which places charge admission, but does not tell you the admission price. It is a great book when accompanied by another (like Lonely Planet or Rick Steves.)

review/text: From Memphis, TN. comes The Reatards, fronted, of course, by wild kid Jay Reatard. He starting off on Eric Oblivians label, Goner, at the tender age of 15. Jay, now 19, is still rocking and offending the sensibilities of his community. Overdriven, loud, crackling guitars underlaying Jay's southern crooning howl energizes some of the most amazing hate-filled song writing we've heard in years.

review/summary: there's still life on Earth
review/text: The Reatards' music is really something that hasn't nothing to do with common and usual comments and impressions on someone's music. This record(and their first record too)is not for everyone. All of the essence of true Punkrock, of true Rock And Roll is in their songs. I mean that their sound is BEFORE and OVER the concept of music, songwriting and melody: it's really something SUPERIOR. It comes directly from HEART, from SOUL, without any mediation, any reflection; it is the real, concrete expression of the Plato's concept of Sublime. The first feedback you have from their record is the sensation that The Reatards have an incredible urgency to express their HATE; but I really think that it actually is LOVE,LOVE,LOVE from a HEART with a DIVINE INSPIRATION. In their songs, in their screams, in their unbelievable, uncontrollable urge and fury there's a strong light from God, from Dyonisus. The covers of old punk-favorites are many, but the originals are better: &quot;Tonight it'll come&quot; stands as the &quot;Chinese Rocks&quot; of the third millennium. Along with The Oblivians(from Memphis too), the best band of the 90's.

review/text: To listen to the Reatards second record, &quot;grown up, fucked up&quot;, is to be able to place your head inside a black and white Zenith television set with your mouth wide open and choke on the dusty cables inside. Each song is nothing but a teaser of such maniacal rock frenzy fuzz that is barely tolerable, even to the strong at heart. But, thats the beauty. Memphis never sounded so good being portrayed by three lads who stare at the sun, while sweating out electric frustration on their living room floors.

He does everything from shooting a buffalo while riding a horse, to bowfishing under water and shooting a large shark. He even has a technical chapter on bowmaking, and his style of shooting. Any archer will enjoy reading this book.

review/summary: The Best Archery Book I've Ever Read!
review/text: Hunting the Hard Way is the best book I have ever read. This book is about the adventures of Howard Hill and others that accompanied him on his hunting trips. Howard Hill used a laminated bamboo longbow that he made in his archery shop. He was an excellent shot with the bow also. He took some amazing shots at animals in this book. The most amazing shot in my opinion was at an elk at over 150 yards! He also went hunting with his bow and arrow.

review/text: The first 2 chapters of this book locked this reader to the pages like an arrow nocked to the string. The thoughts and feelings expressed by Howard Hill as he came to full draw on each of his adventures put me in the saddle or atop the mountain looking through his eyes. Any archer's heart will race at the reaccounting of each hunt, but only archers of traditional caliber will be able to appreciate the flight of the arrow as it's loosed and hits its intended mark. The bond between fellow hunters is well expressed and gives proper account to the knowledge and wisdom passed down at the campfire by older more experienced hunters. But for the fact that Howard Hill has accomplished things with his bow that I wouldn't begin to consider, I found it difficult to associate with some of his underwater adventures.

review/text: If you are involved with archery, this book belongs in your library. Howard Hill posessed skills that are nothing short of incredible when it came to hunting and target archery. This book will inspire you to pick up your bow and go out and shoot. It might even inspire someone to but down his compound and pick up a real bow. This book is a compilation of accounts from Howards career that would be written off as fantasy if so many people hadn't witnessed what Howard was able to accomplish with a longbow. Howard attempts to describe making bows and other archery tackle. I wouldn't buy the book for these reasons. There are other sources such as the bowyer's bible series that do a much better job.

review/summary: An entertaining panorama on magics and demon
review/text: Seligmann, an artist and a &quot;bibliophiliac&quot; of twentieth century, presents a noteworthy panorama on the roots of magic and ancient beliefs &amp; superstitions in this richly illustrated work. This is not a book an enthustiastic &quot;Wicca&quot; would be enjoyed or feel excited to read. Rather it is a well organized collection of historical accounts (mostly dealing with the &quot;Western&quot; side of the subject) and esoteric knowledge. Seligmann provides us a classified history of magic, beginning with ancient Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Canaan and Greece; then shifts the main route towards the medieaval Europe. All sections concerning with ancient cultures has very interesting details on ancient rituals, myths and the concept of &quot;demons&quot;. He especially provides very interesting material on Hermetic philosophy and gnosticism. The hundreds of illustrations in the book, add an entertaining taste into the story. This book would have well deserved &quot;five stars&quot; if it included ancient Eastern beliefs and rites in same detailed style, so I rate Seligmann's work with 4 stars. But in general, &quot;The History of Magic and Occult&quot; is a &quot;compact encyclopedia&quot;, you'd like to own.

It's very 'academic', which I often find is synonomous with dry. I understand why the flashy New Age books sell - they capture the audience who doesn't go for the more scholarly approach... and I have difficult reading this book without my mind wandering.That said - it's not about flash, it's about substance... and it is a very interesting and informative piece of works.

After every story I had to sit back an process the incredible story I had just read. Rivera-Valdez uses her ease with words to paint not just a portrait of each character, but a landscape. Not only are you able to fully enjoy the secrets in the stories, but you will find yourself wondering what goes on behind your own neighbors' curtains.

review/summary: A Painful Read... Break Out the Coffee
review/text: The topic explored by the author is the practice of forgery in late Antiquity to substantiate a religious cult's legitimacy. As a revised version of the author's doctoral thesis and his first book, it has page after page of unnecessary excerpts whose sole purpose seems to be to let the reader know that the author really has passed his language proficiency exams. These are then followed an apology trying to explain why they really were worth quoting. It is a very boring read. Besides these stylistic annoyances, the entire structure of the book takes the form of a survey of various instances of pseudepigrapha... which are then dutifully stretched back to the initial lackluster thesis. There are no fantastic insights in this book. Unless you are doing a specialization in this field, I would not recommend buying this book. There are many better books in the study of religion to be savored. If you must have it for a specialization, I would recommend finding it at a university library... though it may have a limited availability since it is only a revamped standard doctoral thesis that is not widely applicable in many areas of study.

review/summary: It was published. That's an accomplishment.
review/text: First, this text is not the source of the interrelation between Mediterranean Sea cultures. Every book on Hellenistic kingdoms or the Roman Empire presupposes (or should) interrelation of cultures because those political boundaries encompassed a variety of cultures. (A "specialist" should know this.) This text is just what it says: a chronicle of Homer and Moses citings.Second, other authors have expounded on this topic: they have, and they will again. I'm not going to explain in depth here because to do so would be to give away my doctoral thesis. I don't particularly want to see someone else take my sources, present my argument, and have my book published under his/her name.Third, it is extremely difficult to write a doctoral thesis, from my experience. So, while I cannot say that it is the best work on the topic, I think we should have sympathy for doctoral student writers. It is publish or perish, after all. At least it was published. I can only hope for so much for myself.Whether or not you the reader purchase this book is a matter of your own choice. Having to go back to the library for it too often is an indication that one is using it as a reference and not looking to the original sources. That is ill-advised. (Of course, libraries are the friends of "specialists.") But if you have money, and it would make you happy just to peruse every now and then... then by all means give your financial support to Amazon and the author.

review/text: The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The "finish" was worn across the entire top of the screen.

review/text: We were surprised. Pleasantly.A weighty, perfect model of this classic screen would certainly not be available for anything close to the price of the Uniflame model, but the Uniflame looks amazingly good anyway. This thing does the trick!We bought it to replace an "original" solid brass model costing nearly $500 (and it's cheap construction design eventually giving way to its heaviness when moved). As long as someone doesn't examine the new screen from close-up, it actually looks better (not really terrible at all close-up), and it's lighter weight makes it easy to handle.JRT

review/summary: Scraped across the whole top.
review/text: Purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top. The box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material, but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom. However, since it was in another smaller box, I'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with, and not from shipping. Still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage. I wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and I really need a screen right now. Other than the damage, it's a very nice screen.

It's light enough that it can be moved with ease, but still feels sturdy enough that it should last for years to come. Great product, great experience.

review/summary: Great Music - Packaging Needs Help
review/text: I'm not sure if the effects of the CD can match the claim or not (we shall see...) but the music IS really, really good. Very trancey, some dancey and lots of tribal/world music & atmospheric sounds. If you like Delirium, Enigma or downbeat/chill you will love this album a lot. It's definitely more 'modern' sounding and uses many different virtual instrumentation passages that are artfully arranged. Nicely recorded as well. I love popping this in and driving to work during my 'alone time', it really helps inspire some great visualizations (for me). However, don't expect fancy packaging: I thought the price was a bit steep for receiving a store bought slimline jewel case with a one-sided paper handmade insert. And the disc itself is blank. You have to be aware of what side you are putting in because there is absolutely no artwork or print on it. I've made my own cds before, and for a tiny bit extra they could have had the CDs printed at least, or had regular sized jewel cases....but that's just my personal taste perhaps. I also know that musicians are screwed out of their money in lots of other ways so maybe the extra price is partly Amazon's cut and only a portion goes to the artist (I don't doubt). Besides, it's always nice to support independent artists, so I didn't really mind. Either way, it is really lovely and unusual music for you to meditate to, groove to or imagine to. I usually have it on at work all day...I recommend it.

review/summary: Profound then. Truly horrible now.
review/text: The narrative style of this work by famous founders' biographer John Morse is arrogant, flippant and frequently exaggerated. It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now. If it weren't for the fact that Morse wrote this piece 110 years ago, I'd have rated it only one star.

review/summary: pretty good, especially for the younger kids (2-3 years plus)
review/text: I think this one is our favourite game for my younger daughter. She could play this when she was 2.5 years and loved it. It may be a bit simple for the older kids (6+) as they will do it fairly quickly as there are not many challenges or puzzles to solve.This is more of an art game than a challenge game - lots of decorating with the 6 different paintbrushes (each creates a different scene) and there are many decorate it yourself items like making flowers for the garden, making the masks and the decorating the thrones. There is no wrong way to do them (you can't get decorating wrong like you can with the puzzles).The only negative would be the maze at the end, you have to move with the arrow keys and this I always have to help her with as it is a bit difficult. The graphics are great, sound great and my favourite is most of the game is done with the mouse so it is easy for kids (not like the Pegasus game which is terrible!). Older kids may prefer the Princess and the Pauper game if they want a game that lasts longer.

review/summary: A fun game for younger Barbie fans
review/text: My three year old adores this game. The game only takes 2-3 hours to complete in one sitting, but my child has played it over and over, and still loves it. The box recommends this game for ages 5 and older, but my daughter can play this game by herself with ease, except for the maze (which is fairly easy, but she needs help working the arrow keys). This game is mostly a "paint" type game, where you decorate different rooms in a castle in order to save Prince Stephan and the castle. You paint and place different decorations about the castle, as well as "build" a planter and a mosaic tile. The game and the decorations are quite cute, and easy for young Barbie fans to do independently. I feel it does have some educational value as well, in that my daughter seems to have improved her mouse skills from playing this game, has grasped concepts like clicking a "done" button when she has completed a task, and seems to have become better at listening to directions. My one and only complaint is that I wish there had been just a couple more rooms in the castle to decorate. Still, for a fairly short game, it has lots of replay value in it, and the length is just right for a young attention span. I would recommend this game to people with young children who are Barbie fans, especially if their kids aren't quite ready for the more advanced thinking that games geared for older kids have. Don't get me wrong, I think older Barbie fans will like this game, too, if they want to play a game that mostly centered on decorating. I've had problems finding games that my daughter can play independently at her age, plus she's a huge Barbie fan, so this game was perfect for us.

review/text: I purchased this for my daughter that had just turned 5 and with a little help from me in the maze area she was able to finish the game rather quickly (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) but to my surprise she still wants to play it over and over again redecorating the castle differently each time room, by room. She has figured out the maze area on her own now as well, at first naviagating Barbie is a little difficult, but all in all as a rainy day game she loves it! Sometimes I have to set the timer to get her off the computer. Not a lot in the way of learning, but that is what her "Reader Rabbit" CD-Rom's are for anyway - this one is for fun! Additionally I didnot have any technical problems setting up this CD for my daughter, and I have had with many others including her Reader Rabbit, and Disneys.

review/summary: Kids love it...but has annoying flaw
review/text: The kids have played this a lot, and it does seem to stimulate their creativity. To start the child enters her name...later, her name shows up during the game. It only takes them a couple of hours to go through the whole adventure. Of course, it is good enough they want to play it again. But to start over from the beginning, you must enter a new name. We started with their names, then went to full names, now on initials...next I guess we'll have to put in the dog's name. The login page has all these name variations on it, and is becoming ridiculously long. Wrote to tech support, and got the following reply:The response to your question:----------------------------------------Solution Added On 12/31/2002 2:29PMThis is true. The only way to go on is to create a new game with a new name.---------------------Well, that was very helpful.

review/summary: Educational and Fun
review/text: I have always encouraged outdoor exercise instead of the computer, however I don't mind my 5 year old daughter playing with this game. It teaches them creativity, puzzle solving, logic and listening comprehension. Barbie gives them hints if they come to an impasse and presents a certificate with their name on it when they navigate through a maze, which is a great tool for self-esteem, confidence and accomplishment.The graphics and sound are superb,and it will not intimidate first time users. I highly recommend this CD-Rom for ages 4 and up-it is worth the price paid. Lisa Horne

review/text: This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5), it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the CD...if you click no, it will not let you play. So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I've been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my "operating system limitations". This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions.

review/summary: Mac Users Beware
review/text: We were glad to find a Barbie PC game that can run on a Mac. However, note that the requirements to run the game on a Mac are: Power Mac, G3 266 MHz or faster processor, Mac OS 8.6, 9.1.2, 9.2, or 10.1.2. We have a Mac running OS 10.2.8 (just the next version). I assumed the game would still be compatible since most software can run on an OS that is slightly greater than the one required. This game will not work with OS 10.2.8 at all. I planned on calling Apple to see if there was some plug-in/fix I could download to make it work, but never got around to it.Luckily, my Mom has a Windows PC, so my 5 year old daughter gets to play the game when she goes to Grandma's house. She LOVES the game and has not gotten tired of it at all (but she can play once or twice a month). The concept is fun and straight forward, and has more than 1 level. She got the game when she was 4 and had no problems learning how to use it, but she's always been pretty good on the computer.

review/text: I bought this very rich program for my bright 4 year-old who has significant problems with patience and focus/attention. She likes the video very much. This video has been very helpful in rewarding her for working patiently and methodically. At the same time it is great for teaching shapes, use of color, and fine motor control.

review/summary: This is an excellent game!!
review/text: If you haven't already gotten this game for either your child or yourself, I personally recommend it VERY much. It is one of the best computer games for children I have ever seen. I recently got it for my daughter, and it is a very interesting game. There are lots of activities on the game, even printable items. It is a great learning game for any child because, while they think it's a fun game, it also teaches children some basic computer and everyday skills. I love this and I'm a mother, so I'm sure that you will be satisfied with this. I was very surprised at how great it is. I suggest that if you are looking for a great computer game for a young one, this would be THE one to get. I really recommend this!!

It is essentially just clicking on the screen to make it play the 7 or 8 scenes it has programmed. There are no games to play, nothing to figure out, nothing to do. Save your money.

I recommend this game for any 4-8 year old girl.

review/summary: Barbie Rupenzel CD - Good but annoying parts
review/text: I'm StoryMaker. Me, Russian Blue Witch, and Chocolate Dog borrowed it from a friend who has lots of computer games and I'm jeolus. Anyways, I'm a good artist. I love art. Only I can find this a little bad. Something that really really really really annoys me is you can only fit 12 names on the sign-in list! That is NOT average, I read you can fit 99 names on other games. And since this is like other games and you need to start a new user for a new game after me and RBW and C-Dog played it a few times whenever we tried to type a name in the box it gave us an error message that said that the list is full and you press Ctrl and D to delete a name or something and I counted the users...there are 12. And it is hard to choose what things to use and I like the things where you don't choose from things and it annoys me in those things you can't get out of the lines even though you're using a P-brush. Espeaking of p-brushes the p-brush in the 'choose' thing it is annoying because you can't to half-n-half! And after you do something, you can't change it and when you're done and go to the maskarade ball there ussaly is no mask! What I mean is Barbie is not holding a mask, just a stick with a feather on it. Signed, StoryMaker. "Gotta trust the kid's review!"

review/summary: barbie rapunzel = crying child
review/text: My 6-year old daughter is currently sobbing in her bedroom as a result of this rotten game.She spent an hour on this game painting in pretty pictures and coloring in flowers. But halfway through the game, the program hung, and wouldn't let us leave the room or click anywhere else. Now even if we exit the game and then start it back up, we are frozen in one spot while Barbie's disembodied voice urges us to "explore somewhere else in the castle."Standard software troubleshooting and rebooting didn't help. Vivendi Games' support site is "currently disabled." And now I'm left with a weeping, frustrating child who doesn't understand that it is not her fault that her game won't work. I'm hoping it was just incompetent software programming that couldn't catch the bug my 6-year old caught the first time around. Or maybe they just don't care about the problems, so long as you get our 20 bucks. If you don't want a crying little girl, avoid this game!

review/summary: DEFECTIVE PRODUCT FOR MACINTOSH! RIP OFF ALERT!
review/text: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM IF YOU HAVE A MACINTOSH!!! It ONLY runs on "Classic OS 9", which is an operating system over 8 years old. It does NOT run on OS X at all. A HUGE disappointment and clearly false advertising! Also, the company, BSL Mart, is very difficult to contact. There is no phone number, you can only send them e-mails. Also, the return slip was already peeled off on the packaging slip, so it is obvious that someone else already returned it and BSL Mart just slapped it right back in the package and shipped it off again anyway without even looking at it. My 5-year old daughter was so upset -- we had ordered this as a reward for her good behavior as well as doing her chores and the game is so out-dated it won't even work on a Mac OS 10.3.9 - the Panther version, which was the lowest operating system we could find. PATHETIC. I also placed this in dispute with my Visa card company, and they did put it in dispute but also informed me that in order for it to stick I have to get a "second opinion letter" from a "qualified merchant" who knows about video games! So I HAVE TO DO THE LEGWORK TO GET THIS $[...] removed from my bill - not BSL Mart! You talk about furious. I will never do business with them again. I also will never purchase a game from Amazon unless the ad SPECIFICALLY states hat it will run on a CURRENT operating system. (DUH?!) If there had been a phone number to call before I purchased it I would have but there is none. SAD.

review/summary: Great fun for kids!
review/text: My review is targeted toward those that wish this game for their toddler age kids. I purchased this for my 3 year old daughter. She is a huge fan of the Barbie animated movies and Rapunzel is one of her favorites. This game is so much fun for her! It definately keeps her attention span for long periods of time...which is saying something for a toddler! The game is easy for her to use. This is a good thing because she is very stubborn and independant...she does not like mommy and daddy helping her. Basically, the evil Gothel has cast a spell over the castle and turned the Prince into stone. To win, you must complete each level (which is just transforming it from dark and gloomy into bright and cheery) and then travel through a maze to rescue the Prince. To transform each room, the player gets to pick out paint colors, decorate different accessories in the room, etc. There are plenty of different options for each room to keep the little ones happy! I could defintely see how this would be entertaining for kids of different ages...perfect for siblings with a few years in age difference. I have recently purchased the 12 Dancing Princesses game and it is not anywhere near being as good or entertaining as this one!

review/text: My daughter absolutely loves this game! It's easy to use and requires no adult supervision. Best of all, it allows girls to use their creativity to design their own castle one room at a time. What more could a girl want! My daughter wants to play it every day and I have to find excuses to keep her away! Too bad not all the Barbie games are this easy and fun. I've been very disappointed in others I purchased. I discovered that they're not all designed/published by the same company. I paid 5.99 for this game on clearance and it's been worth 10 times this amount!

review/text: My 6 and 7 year old daughters love this game! They really enjoy decorating the rooms and doing so has really improved their mouse skills. Essentially, a lot of the game is kind of like "coloring" on the computer and they love to color. Hunting for the gems in each room is fun for them. There is also a maze at the end as well as a bunch of sappy songs that they seem to really enjoy. This is a great choice for girls 4-9 years old.

review/text: My daughters both love this game. Aged 3 and 4, they're already fairly adept computer users, but this game is really particularly well designed for their ages. They love the story line (somewhat different from the movie) and the challenge of having to find all the gems to save the prince. The activities in the game are ones that they play over and over - especially the painting, mosaic puzzle, and design-your-own flowers. They really get to use their creativity, and the tools they can use in the game are really beautiful. We have a lot of kids' computer games, and this one is their hands-down favorite.

And whenever you want to go someplace else you have to click arrows up and down. This game was not fun b/c when you click the arrows up and down it goes somewhere else you do not want it to be at.

review/text: My 3 year old daughter & I both love this software. We actually fight over who is going paint the pictures or choose the themes for each room. This game allows you to be creative & use your imagination by "decorating" each room of the castle and finding the missing gems to the prince's crown which gives Rapunzel the power to find Prince Stephan who has been turned to stone & bring him back to life. The music & animation is the best I have seen. Most of the kids software that I've seen is boring to me as an adult, but this is not at all. I sometimes like to play it without her! There are so many variations on color schemes & patterns & that you can never be bored. I highly recommend this for girls of all ages.

After seeing it many times on her "wish list" I warned her that it would most likely be boring. Boy was I wrong! We have spent many rainy day hours decorating rooms and having such fun. You can do so much and make it so different each time. We decide on colors and themes of rooms and go to town. I gave her a big hug and kiss for being so persistant about getting this software.

review/text: I would definitely recommend buying this CD. My 5 year old loved it. It is visually breathtaking and will engage young ones for hours. The only drawback is that you only get to redecorate the castle. There is no variation to the tasks so that once you've completed the castle, if you want to play again, you do exactly what you had done before but there is a great deal of variety and combinations for decorating the castle. It is like a very sophisticated coloring book.

review/text: My 5-year-old daughter LOVED this game. It developed her creativity and held her attention long enough to finish it in one sitting. She still loves the theme song, which she memorized immediately. My two complaints: 1) Once you have completed the entire game, you must sign in under a different name in order to play again. 2) The game has no variations or higher levels to challenge the player as her skill improves. My daughter finished the game on her first attempt in about 45 minutes, but as she played more and became familiar with where all the items were, it took less and less time to finish a game. She's starting to become bored with it.One last thing (and I guess you can count this as complaint #3): will game developers EVER come up with something for girls that challenges their critical skills and doesn't involve dressup or makeovers?

review/summary: Not so good - ok for a rental!
review/text: This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. The only bad thing is that there is only one "castle" for the kids to "decorate" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did. My sister finished the "castle" in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money.

They love everything about it, from the theme song at the beginning, to finding Prince Stefan in the maze at the end. I will admit, it's not super educational, but it does keep them entertained and it's nice to have a "fun" game once in awhile that doesn't require them to think too hard! It's also nice because they can leave the game midway, and return back to where they left off by clicking on their name. The names can also be deleted so that they can start a fresh game. They can restore the castle over and over again and have it be different every time. I think it was totally worth the money.

review/summary: Great,maybe for a 10 year old...
review/text: Hi,I'm 'BARBIE LOVER' and I really like this game,even though I'm a bit out of the age range. :) I like going around and decorating every room in the castle differently each time I play!(like the whole castle decorated with peacocks or swans or butterflies,or one room has horses and another masqarade masks,exc.)The thing which really nags me is that every time you have 12 names on your list you have to erase one to play again.I usually just erase the whole list so I won't have to do this that often. I also like the intro to the game,and the muscic in each room before you restore it. I even reconized a bit of music from the movie! If you love Fantasy,dragons,and rapunzel you should get the movie-and this very fun game!(The movie is very nice,even though it is 4 years old!)And another thing-Barbie's mask is not a mask-it is just a feather in the air-have you seen it? PS Please vote on my review! 'BARBIE LOVER'

review/summary: NOT OS X but MAC CLASSIC
review/text: NEGATIVE: This game does not work with OS X and requires the CD so you can't have it on multiple computers. It is slow I have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot, this is because it has to access the CD everytime there is a new task. You can't view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files. Some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adults.it CRASHES all the time.Mouse is jumpy and hard to use.POSITIVE: Some tasks are easy, possible to use, grand and beautiful.My three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work.

review/summary: Over all, an okay game
review/text: My daughters have both enjoyed playing this game. One of them is 6 yrs. old and the other is 3 1/2 yrs. old. and they both have had no trouble mastering this game. The down side to this game is that it is redundant/repeatitive. It is the same things over and over again, only you can change the patterns and colors of the items you are working on. In order to be able to play again after you have completed it, you must go and remove their name from the sign-in page 'then' retype it! This little chore is very annoying after awhile. The graphics are very nice and colorful and it does allow your child to use her imagination and to be creative, but all in all , I think the game was way too pricey for what it is. After having this in our house for 4 months, my girls have become rather bored with it.

review/summary: Simple Game - Started My Daughter on Computers
review/text: This game got my daughter started on computers when she was 2. She is 6 now and a computer wizard for her age. When she was 2, I had to get the game up and running and give her a hand frome time to time, but she learned to work independently. The game has two modes: storybook and interactive. Your child can view the story or they can help Barbie at many steps along the way. My daughter jumped to interactive right away. This game may be to simple for Kids over 5. The game can also help young girls feel comfortable with using a computer and learn to load games and use a mouse.

review/summary: good but pricey
review/text: Images are pretty, nice combination of colors, and is well done. My 4 year old daughter loves it at first and only took her a couple of hours to complete the adventure (she did need some adult help to get her started and more help to go through the maze). After that, she doesn't play with it as much ... and thus why I think it's pricey ... Not quite a learning experience as the Jump Start series.

review/text: I bought this for my 5 year old daughter. She LOVES this CD-ROM! It has excellent graphics and is easy for her to navigate through. It has many different options in how you "restore" the castle and keeps her interest up. I would recommend this product. It even has a print option to print pages from the scrapbook of rooms you have restored.

review/text: My daughter loved this game, and it really kepted her at the computer for hours, but it was finished in one day at our house. It was a long day, but still one day. The positives about the game though is that they can go back and redecorate the castle different the next time they play, so my dayghter actually played it again a few days later so she could see what the castle would look like if she decorated it differently.

review/text: BARBIE AS RAPUNZEL: A CREATIVE ADVENTURE. I don't like Barbie, yet even with my negative attitude I appreciated the Barbie as Rapunzel adventure. This is a creative game in which the player must help Barbie free Prince Stefan from an evil spell by restoring a cursed and very run-down castle. The player takes Barbie around the castle and selects colors and patterns to decorate with magic paintbrushes and wands. Once each room is redecorated, Barbie retrieves a gem that will eventually be placed in the prince's crown to break the spell on him. The Barbie and Prince get to live in their renovated home - happily ever after, of course.

review/summary: Bad Deal!!
review/text: I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future.

review/text: I got this game, and the IT Expansion pack, deeply discounted at a game store. I must say that this is the first card game that I can actually relate to from personal experience. What fun. If you work in an office, and especially if you work in the IT department, this may be a fun game to play during lunch (in the rare event you do actually get to not work during lunch) or "after hours" with your friends. It will probably get old after a few plays, as the gags and cartoons are really funny only the first time one sees them, but it's great to play this game at least once just for laughs.

review/summary: Richardson's book a brilliant look at a mysterious person
review/text: This book combines two of the most sought-after items in a biography. First, in Williams, you have an intriguing, mysterious figure who not many people have much information on. Yes, he won the Heisman trophy and he is, publically, seen as a good person.What Richardson, the most respected college sports writer in the country, is able to do is look beyond the public perception and give readers a sense of what makes Williams tick and why Williams ticks the way he does.This book sets the stage for Williams in New Orleans. It is set before Williams' rookie year with the Saints and controversial coach Mike Ditka. After reading this book, you'll understand why Williams had the turbulent year and subsequent problems.Through a network of what seem to be unparalled contacts, Richardson is able to gain an insight on Williams the college player that has never before been exposed. He sets the table for Williams' rookie year. Much of the book explains how Williams was handled in college at Texas and why his transition to the real world has been so difficult.In short, this book is a must for any pro football fan. On a grand scale, it is much more than a work about Ricky Williams and the Saints. It chronicles the reasons college players have such a difficult time making the trasition to the professional level and explains why football is only part of that equation.

review/summary: Excellent book for handling feelings
review/text: This is my favorite parenting (and lifeskills) book for learning how to identify, process, and master one's feelings. It is so practical and really applies to any age of child/adult and parenting style. The goal of the book is to empower kids (and parents) to be responsible for their own feelings by identifying and handling them in appropriate ways.A variety of techniques are recommended depending on the age of the child and the child's own particular personality. (From art to music to reading to physical exercises and so much more).The author suggests that for each year of age a child has, they should develop that many coping mechanisms when they are upset for how to get their feelings under control and process them.This book strikes an excellent balance between the one extreme that says "You have no business feeling that way - just deal with it" which leads to stuffing emotions and angry outbursts, and the other extreme which focuses so much on talking about feelings "You're angry, you're upset, tell me how you feel, let's focus on your feelings for hours ad nauseum" that the child feels trapped by their own feelings and isn't given tools for moving beyond the situation.Highly highly recommend this book! You as the parent will also come away with new and better coping skills for yourself.

review/text: While the movie in itself was better than i expected what i didnt expect was the "non existent" Thai soundtrack. While the option was on the disc menu (as well as stated on the package) the Thai soundtrack does not exist. No matter what you choose, Thai or English, English is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par. While this review covers only the first movie of the two the other may remain in plastic never to see the inside of my dvd player. Its a shame and a sham when you purchase what claims to be original and is not. Very disapointed in this offering from Tokyo Shock.

This is among the last of the great SUC records. Not to say they've fallen off....just they've downsized so much with the deaths of the screw pioneers. Sad but true. If ya love Tx rap, you've gotta get this 1. Somethin to kickback & blow big too, somethin to jam in the ride. So underrated, right here. I wish people would forget all the bullsh** on BET/MTV and check what's happening in Houston. But i guess...it's sadly almost too late. Pat's gone, hawk's gone...screw, Moe, Pimp C, Big Steve. Makes me sad. Regardless, Pokey is still alive and making new music, keeping the legacy alive. And this is a great place to start with him. Classic record. Love it, man

But, I'll tell you, Pokey sounds a lot like Biggie Smalls (BIG). He has biggie's style, usin words like sho nuff. Pokey's lyrics are good, but a few lyrics could use a little work. A few of his songs have complex beats, but most have a little bit of a more simple beat. The album comes together great. Get it! Trust me...its worth the money

review/summary: Hamelin does it again
review/text: I confess to being a Hamelin fanatic! To me, Marc-Andre Hamelin is the best pianist performing today and I anxiously await new recordings by him. The Brahms is one of the greatest concertos ever written and it's one of my favorites. Hamelin plays it supperbly and the orchestra, under Litton's leadership, provides exceptional support. This is a "must have" CD for anyone who loves great piano playing. The Hyperion sound is fabulous, as usual too.

review/summary: Fun math!
review/text: My daughter received this for her third birthday. She was able to do level 1 (shapes) and level 2 (counting) pretty independently, if I separated the left and right side pieces from each other and told her she needed to pick one from each side. Having the bus to "frame" her pieces was helpful. I love that they put the number words under the numbers. After she found the match for six, she said "S-I-X makes six!" and was very proud of herself. We started doing level three, but only the addition, and she was fine with it. I can see what a previous reviewer said about subtraction being a problem by covering the second number with the picture, though. But so far, she's enjoying her success, enjoying putting the pieces together, and feeling very smart indeed. The pieces are made of strong cardboard, which should be durable enough to last until she is no longer interested. I think this might be too easy for a five or six year old, though, and the recommended age is up to age 6.

review/summary: Great Learning Game for Varying Levels of Ability
review/text: My son enjoys this game very much. It requires you to find objects that match specific shapes and numerals, and it offers beginning addition and subtraction as well. Children know they've got the right answer when the puzzle pieces match up, which is really fun. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the subtraction part of the game has the potential to be confusing. For example, on one puzzle piece it shows three apples with a number 3 below it, a minus sign, and then one apple with a number 1 below it. While you and I know that three minus one is 2, when I presented this to my son, he covered the one apple that was after the minus sign, looked at the initial three apples, and said "three." If your child has a problem with this as well, I recommend using real food or household objects (e.g. apples, markers, spoons, crayons) to teach subtraction. Then, when you present three objects and ask your child how many there are when they take away one, they can clearly see there are only two left.

review/summary: Excellent perspective on communal living and human nature
review/text: Ironically, I grew up in a small town close to The Farm, but never knew much about it. A friend asked me about it, and when forced to confront my ignorance on the subject I purchased the book to correct that shortcoming. Little did I know how much I was about to be entertained!Voices from The Farm is written--as a book on the communal living experience should be--by a number of the folks who participated. It is a collection of stories that together summarize the experience of the members, and the life-cycle of the community.The Farm and its various off-shoots accomplished some great humanitarian feats in the face of the suspicion and prejudice of its neighbors. Winning over those neighbors provides some of the most entertaining tales in the book. However, the biggest obstacles seem--as with human society in general--to be rooted in the human nature of the members of The Farm community.This book is a great, entertaining collection of stories that together tell the tale of a marvelous exercise in social science and community economics. Excellent work by the editors in preserving, selecting, and arranging the individual contributions to tell the story of The Farm.

review/summary: Intense memoir told in brief segments by former members of The Farm
review/text: This book gave me a glimpse at life on The Farm, as described by people who'd actually lived there. While no book can EVER be a substitute for the daily reality of living on the land, trying to build a community, take care of children, raise food and get through cold winters, reading this book was still a very powerful experience. It made me think about my spiritual values and what it must have been like for those who were trying to live with a commitment to living gently on the earth, not hurting wild creatures, not using leather.I appreciated the honesty as well - as varous people would talk of giving into corruption and sneaking Dr. Pepper soda on a trip to town and other acts that went against general group values. Some of these values, of course were not overtly stated...but most were understood. Others were in a state of transition.Ultimately, the Farm broke up but this book is a powerfl reminder of all that was good about it and of the yearning for finding new ways of building stronger community lives. I have no way of knowing for sure, but I have a feeling many members of The Farm continue to live with similar values as they had back then, when they were simply thought of as crazy "hippies".

review/summary: awesome book about group dynamics of any kind
review/text: This book is a collection of oral histories and some original documents from the early days of the famous Farm commune in Tennessee. The Farm had a fairly hierarchical structure compared to some hippie efforts, and identified as a spiritual community, with a large amount of group effort and work involved in basic infrastructure, social experiments, and, eventually, charity projects that were difficult for the cash-strapped group to support (like maintaining an ambulance service in besieged Bronx neighborhoods, hundreds of miles from the Farm home base in Tennessee, as well as projects in Central America during a guerrilla war that threatens local partners in the project).The stories are a FANTASTIC look at group dynamics and, in my opinion, give a great look at the consequences of the "mission creep" that idealistic projects such as nonprofits and religious organizations are prone to. Much of this is very entertaining, often in a black-humor sort of way, and gives a great look at commonalities in human nature that apply today, whether to today's version of 'hippies', or any hard-working and idealistic group of humans trying to better the world.

review/summary: A Good Look at the Culture of Assyrians and Israelites
review/text: I was introduced to this book when I was a teenager. I loved it then, and was pleasantly surprised to see it still available. Reading it again to my own children, it was better than I remembered, and loved by all of them, from ages 6 to 14. Although at times the heroine is presented as almost too good to be true, the plot of the book is exciting, and left my children asking me to read one more chapter. The setting of the book provides a great amount of historical detail, leaving the reader with an excellent understanding of the Israelites' constant fear of raiding and invasion by the Assyrians, and a good grasp of daily life in Assyria. The book takes a few unexpected twists and turns, and has enough unanswered questions throughout to keep readers of all ages interested. All in all, a very good choice to help understand this time period.

review/summary: The Battleship Bismarck reviewed
review/text: This book is both a history and a photo album of the famous German battleship, and the photos are particularly useful in showing both the construction stages of the ship and for the many interior shots. That said, this book has a couple of problems. One is its age; it was originally published in 1975, and the authors appear not to have taken advantage of the information that appears in Ludovic Kennedy's "Pursuit," published the previous year. As a result, there are statements in this book, particularly concerning the Bismarck's chronology, that have been disproved by more recent discoveries. The other big problem is the translation, which appears to have been done very literally by someone with little knowledge of naval nomenclature. Thus, "Seekriegsleitung" gets translated as "sea-war-leadership," which may be a literal translation, but ignores the more generic term "naval operations," which is what this really means. This problem becomes particularly aggravating in trying to follow the time-line of events surrounding the destruction of the Hood and the Bismarck, which, as translated, make almost no sense. The diagrams, which are in German and are not translated, seem fairly accurate, although during the destruction of the Bismarck they appear to show the King George V firing torpedos at the Bismarck, when in fact the King George V had no torpedo tubes. It's also puzzling that the translator, according to the note at the end of the book, was unaware until 1989, with the publication of Robert Ballard's book on the discovery of the Bismarck, of the number of German sailors rescued after the sinking of the Bismarck. Even here, his figures are wrong--he states that 115 men were rescued by the British. In fact, British warships rescued 111 men (one later died and was buried at sea) while a German submarine and a German weather ship rescued the other five. A marginally useful book, although much of its information has been supersceded by more recent discoveries and research.

They are just the right weight of fabric for those cool winter mornings in Southern California (not so for 85degree summer days, when I'll stash them away for cooler days to come). My size is somewhere between a medium and a large. These adidas pants are amply cut, but maybe a tad too roomy for my particular build. A medium would probably be restrictive when I'm doing calesthenics or some weight exercises. This being said, I am nevertheless very happy with this product and with Amazon's superior service.

review/summary: NOW... That's what I Call Electro-rock
review/text: Practically ignored by music criticism (even by indie critics), this record really makes everything DFA has produced sound like crap (by the way, I love DFA)... Soulwax has always been a rock band as oposed to their alias "2 many djs" that is used for electronic work, remixing and DJing. But this record takes the better of both names, Soulwax remixed (or re-created) their own songs and if that was not enough they open the album with an amazing rock cover of Daft Punks's "Teachers". 2manyDJS has also been known for their bastard pop tracks, and they do it here too in songs like "NY Lips" (sampling Funky town in a much more "funky" way than the original)... Potent beats and basslines are heard all over the songs, samples and lyrics are funny and fascinating.My humble advice: buy this record... now!

review/summary: Nite Or Day, You Are The One
review/text: In lieu of a new studio album, Soulwax have done the increasingly common thing and released a remix record to quench the public's thirst for new material. Remix releases can be nasty, barrel scraping affairs (just look at the recent Le Tigre compilation for proof), but in light of the critical hiding Any Minute Now copped upon its release in 2004, it's interesting to note the favourable attention Soulwax have attracted since NY Excuse was released earlier in the year in remixed form. Although that radio-friendly track doesn't make it to Nite Versions, there's two other versions of NY Excuse on offer, with NY Lipps incorporating a smattering of Lipps, Inc's classic disco cheese Funky Town to groovy effect. While second version Another Excuse is a DFA and Soulwax collaboration, sadly the gathering of minds looks better on paper than it sounds in reality, ensuring NY Lipps and its pots and pans percussion make for the better NY Excuse remix. Elsewhere on Nite Versions Soulwax's Dewaele brothers cover Daft Punk on album opener Teachers, completely reinvent E Talking save for a bassline and add an air of volatility to Compute via the use of a harpsichord.As proven by their 2 Many DJs sideline, the Dewaeles know their way around a mix disc, with Nite Versions sampling LA Style's James Brown Is Dead on I Love Techno, adding Ultravox-style flourishes to Accidents And Compliments and seguing tracks with a perfect fusion.Next up is their production role with Canada's Tiga, but for now Nite Versions satisfactorily keeps the interest in the Belgians high.

Anyway, I'd heard of this album but never paid too close attention to it. I had no idea what I'd been missing. HOLY SH!T am I impressed, this is exactly whats been missing for the past couple years. I've been waiting for this for so long, yet here it was this whole time. From beginning to end this CD grabs hold & doesn't let go, simply amazing music from start to finish. Do all yourselves a favor and buy this CD, it's finally available domestically, there's no reason not to own it. You'll thank me later.

review/summary: Why is SOULWAX ignored by critics & consumers alike?!
review/text: I just don't get it - SOULWAX has been around since the 90s, when they released their "rock" debut (on the now defunct Almo Sounds), chock full of should-have-been radio hits, and then when while they got some attention for their "2 Many DJs" mash-up/remix bootlegs, when they return to a full-fledged band, as with last year's ANY MINUTE NOW, critcs & consumers alike barely took notice of that album's amazing writing, production, and sheer electro-rock power. Hopefully, "Nite Versions" (a cheeky title recalling when 80s bands like Duran Duran used to release "Nite Version" on 12" of singles for clubs) will garner more sales and attention for SOULWAX - the songs practically leap out of the speakers to grab your neck and turn you head and make you move. Can't wait to hear what they do TIGA on his upcoming "Sexor" debut...?

review/summary: cheesy, very dated, and well... the beginning of a great career
review/text: I don't know exactly when Jason Bateman started his career, but after watching Arrested Development the last several years (reruns of course) I wanted to tune into Moving Target to find out what he looked like as a teenager. WOW, haha. He looks pretty much the same as he does now, except he's much smaller, and I THINK I remember Jason Bateman being somewhat of a chick magnet for all the teenage girls out there back in the late 80's.Anyway, while I didn't expect Arrested Development-type quality while watching Moving Target (or a comedy for that matter) I can't say this movie does a whole lot of things differently from all the other similar "run from bad guys- shoot bad guys" movies that are out there.The only difference in this film compared to the many similar ones from the same time period is that Bateman plays a teenage boy in this movie as the main character, and he has to run from the bad guy that supposedly has connections to the mob and forces Bateman's parents to change their names and where they live. Why didn't the parents tell Bateman about any of this and instead waited for him to return home from summer camp to find out his parents no longer lived there, so Bateman's character has to be worried sick and constantly confused? I have no idea. Maybe a case of bad parenting. Actually I think it's because Bateman chose to skip summer camp and he ran away early to return home. Maybe the parents WERE planning to tell him when he arrived home.Anyway, it's somewhat cheesy as far as the acting is concerned, but because it's an older film there's something somewhat appealing about the occasional sloppy writing and acting skills. I liked it. Bateman went on to much much MUCH better things (such as Arrested Development) but this movie ain't bad for what it is.

review/text: 2 stars of 5 for this slow dull "classical" 1980's style movie. This movie has a young Jason Bateman in the lead. Very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980's style music. To our relief the background music (which is very annoying) is kept to a minimum. Though it attempts to be an action/suspense movie, it achieves neither. I'd suggest skipping this movie.

review/text: This little book is one of the most important works I have read in my 50+ years. With simple, yet incredibly powerful ideas, it challenged me to get &quot;out of my philosophical box&quot; and think again about life, God, and how it all works together. Recalling the simple statement Jesus made, that we &quot;must become like little children...&quot;, I played along with the exercises outlined in the book and found an earth-shaking change taking place in my life.

review/summary: CLEAR AND INSPIRING EXPLANATION OF SPIRITUAL TREATMENT
review/text: Dr Baker explains clearly and engagingly how one can improve one's life by changing your subconscious pattern through the spiritual technique called treatment. The essence of treatment is this: When the conscious mind of the individual deliberately selects a creative idea and delivers that idea to the subconscious, the subconscious mind acts as a law and proceeds to produce the equivalent of that idea in the individual's experience. The subconscious mind is the producer of one's experience, while the conscious mind is the decider of experience. Both phases of mind are spiritual processes working together - they are the God process in the individual. This wonderful work provides a spiritual technique for richer living. Chapters deal with, inter alia, Happiness, Wealth, Love, Success and Freedom, and includes helpful affirmations and prayers. On a par with the work of Joseph Murphy, Catherine ponder and Florence Scovel-Shinn, this book should be read repeatedly to provide the maximum benefit.

review/text: Dr. Barker opened the First Church of Religious Science in New York City in 1946, was President of the International New Thought Alliance and a well-known minister, author and teacher throughout the New Thought movement. This classic book is often used in Religious Science classes. Dr. Barker explains how to change the subconscious pattern through spiritual treatment. Some of his statements: There are unfortunately a great many people with attractive surface attitudes but with the same old rubbish underneath (9), If you fail to direct your subconscious mind, it produces under a law of averages, and you are a nice, ineffective sweet person (84), I call treatment mind surgery. It is the way in which you go into the subconscious, destroy old patterns and instill new ones (90).

review/summary: Good help for the willing
review/text: Raymond Charles Barker believes in metaphysics, but you need not share his views on such a weighty topic to derive benefit from this book. Treat Yourself to Life is a manual for productive living -- a self-help book you might say -- and Barker provides a straight-forward approach for getting what you want in terms of love, wealth, health and self-expression.Skeptics may cringe at the author's faith in the individual to create his own destiny through the book's teaching, but Barker responds by urging the reader to assess the merits of the teaching based on real results for the individual.The books divides into chapters on Happiness, Wealth, Love, This Day, Success, Freedom and Life, and offers a method to improve one's experience with regard to each. Barker demands faith and effort, but at its core, the method really does not differ much from techniques in cognitive therapy and sqaures with the latest views on neuroplasticity, at least in my view. Yet the teaching seems more positive and offers a greater faith in human nature. Surely, the reader will have to decide for himself.

review/summary: Harnessing thought-power
review/text: Dr Baker was one of those great 20th century metaphysicians like Emmet Fox, Ernest Holmes &Thomas Troward, who understood the working of the mind long before psychotherapy became popular. This approach is called "the religion of healthy mindedness" by William James in his classicThe Varieties of Religious Experience.Barker explains clearly and engagingly how to improve one's life by changing your subconscious pattern through the spiritual technique called `treatment.' The essence of treatment is this: When the conscious mind of the individual deliberately selects a creative idea and delivers that idea to the subconscious, the subconscious mind acts as a law and proceeds to produce the equivalent of that idea in the individual's experience.

review/summary: Highly recommended
review/text: Security specialist Micah Lassiter finds himself in an ethical quandary when wealthy businessman Alan Street hires him to protect his daughter, and Micah quickly finds his heart becoming involved. Allen owns one of the most successful software companies in the world, which now has made him the target of threats. The man sending threatening letters is obviously brilliant, unbalanced and dangerous. Concerned for his daughter, Alan wants someone to keep an eye on Prudence night and day to ensure her safety. But Micah must protect Prudence without her knowledge. She has struggled hard to establish her independence from her father and won't welcome his intrusion now, however well meaning.Micah moves into the apartment across the hall from Prudence, using his proximity to arrange quiet dinners and intimate moments. By necessity, Prudence believes he's courting her, and is confused by his mixed signal when he kisses her on one day and then emotionally distances himself the next. Micah is equally confused by his reactions, knowing that emotional involvement can endanger her safety. Prudence becomes the cause of some real soul searching, as their relationship takes a path he didn't expect. As danger escalates, Micah finds not just her life in danger, but his heart. Further, she won't be tolerant when she finds out her father hired him.Ruth Langan deftly combines danger and romance in BY HONOR BOUND. Langan has a gift for creating wonderful characters. The direct confrontation of the ethical issues provides striking characterizations with believable dilemmas. Her secondary characters likewise sparkle, from the Lassiter family to the meddlesome sisters that live in the same apartment building as Alan and Prudence. Unexpectedly delightful, BY HONOR BOUND comes highly recommended.

review/summary: Map your Imagination
review/text: It's pretty cool looking at one of these maps that started out as satellite photos and then were filled in with cartographic caricatures (with prime features exaggerated out of scale). You are musing "wow, I didn't know that was out there," and pretty soon you're in the car heading out to see something that no one you know ever heard of. I found something on this map out in the vastness of Kansas called the Chalk Hills, looked it up, it's all on private land but apparently the owners don't mind, there are no fences visible and no other tourists, and there are these natural wonders for you to grok at.http://www.kansasphototour.com/chalk.htmhttp://www.kansasphototour.com/castle.htmhttp://www.ourks.com/chalkpyramids.htmlI have one of these in my own backyard, the Sutter Butteshttp://www.middlemountain.org/picture.htmin the upper part of the Central Valley of California.It is normally invisible in Sacramento because of either smog or agricultural dust. I had never seen it, one day it rained and I saw this magic mountain rising out of the plain. I went to bed, had a dream about it, got up out of my sleep and had to drive there. (Unfortunately, the locals glare at you because of all the bad tourists, and this one is fenced, with some places with weird manhole covers and red-&-white striped antennas sticking up out of the ground.)

review/summary: Smartly done
review/text: Due to the time-lag up to the present (5-9 years after the original publication) it needs to be pointed out that some of the essays may have lost shreds from their novelty; while others, like Al Hidell's charting out the EuroAtlantic grand chessplayers' ulterior geostrategical motives (among them g.o.d.= guns, oil/pipelines, drugs) leading up to the violent breakup of Yugoslavia and to the birth of their latest stepchild, say, in the form of Kosovo, are timelier than ever. Just as Israeli connections (far from being the whole picture) to the 9-11 inside job (& the rest), in another offering from the same author/co-editor, cannot be repeated often enough either.Aside from the articles already referred to in the above editorial review, further titles are as follows:Joan d'Arc: Giordano Bruno: 16th-century ufologist?; The Aviary and the Eschaton: an interview with 'Chicken Little'; Marcel Vogel and the secret of the fifth force; w. Frank Berube: Declaring war on the human spirit: the media spectacle vs. the collective psyche. (Sidebar: Worthwhile to note at this juncture that the historical personage Jeanne d'Arc, whose name the contributing author/co-editor borrowed as her nom de guerre, may not have been burnt alive but lived to the age of 57 as Margarita d'Champdiver, daughter of king Charles VI and his mistress Odetta d'Champdiver. See in David McGowan's "Programmed to Kill. The Politics of Serial Murder" (2004, p. 344 fn. 50) citing a Pravda report dated 01/27/2004.)Frank Berube: The Third Reich of Dreams: Charlotte Beradt's "Diaries of the Night".

review/summary: Great advice on caring for your Birman
review/text: I bought this to help understand care issues specific to the Birman breed, and it really helped. The section on exhibition was interesting, but not really relevant to my needs. It was great to have sections on feeding, grooming, temperament, and health that were tailored specifically to the Birman, since this breed of cat is very unique. It goes into detail on health issues of the Birman such as the breed's propensity for kidney disease and the importance of annual blood work. The book also talks about the gentle nature of this cat and how it needs the companionship of humans much more than other breeds and how easily a Birman can get its feelings hurt and even pout. Grooming tips are given on how to take care of the thick yet fine coat of the Birman. I've found it to be the best book on cat care out there for the Birman and I highly recommend it.

review/summary: My new favorite book from the Avon True Romance series.
review/text: Tess was washed ashore on the Isle of May during a terrible storm eleven years ago, presumed to be the only survivor of a shipwreck. Just six years old at the time, Tess had buried horrible memories deep within her, and remembered little of what brought her to the island. An elderly couple living on the island raised her and taught her to be self-sufficient. But now they are dead, and Tess is all alone on the island. She longs for human companionship but has learned to fear the world beyond the Isle of May. When a young Highlander washes ashore in a storm, Tess feels compelled to save him. At twenty years of age, Colin Macpherson is the youngest son of a Highland laird. He's been restlessly roaming the seas, but when he washes up on Tess's island, everything changes. As Colin helps Tess remember her past, he finds himself drawn to her as he's never been drawn to a woman before. And Tess is discovering strong feelings for him as well, feelings that may very well be love. But when they return to the mainland in search of Tess's heritage, will they be able to stay together, or will they be torn apart?Set in Scotland in 1543, this is my new favorite book in the Avon True Romance series. The love story between Tess and Colin was so romantic and incredibly sweet, and I LOVED the setting. If you are a fan of the Avon True Romance series, or like historical romances for teens, this book is a must-read.

review/summary: An awesome novel from May McGoldrick
review/text: After enjoying a previous Avon True Romance, Gwyneth and the Thief, I decided to read more from the series. I thought Gwyneth was great, but this is even better yet. Tess is a seventeen-year-old who lives on the Isle of May. She was taken under the care of a couple who oversaw the island, but they have died, and she is completely alone. One day, she finds that a young man is washed ashore, and drags him from the water. She does not want to be near him, as she was warned to stay away from all men, so she hides on the island. Colin Macpherson, a highlander, searches for the young lady who rescued him. Tess is stubborn, but eventually they get to know one another. Tess does not know much about her past, with the exception of nightmares which give small recollections. Colin realizes that Tess is part of the Lindsay clan, and when a ship comes to rescue him from the island, Tess goes with him, in order to find the life she was taken away from eleven years ago. Will she be able to have peace, and be with Colin, the person she has grown to love? Read this very interesting novel to find out. I really enjoyed reading this. Many congratulations to May McGoldrick on writing such a great novel!

With no memory of the life before then, she stays with the old caretakers of the isle. After the caretakers are dead a young man, Colin Macpherson washes up on shore. Colin takes Tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past. They are opposites,but you know what they say opposites attract. This book is just one of many in the Avon True Romance series. I have read every book in the series and I know that if you like this book you love the rest. This is a great book for girls about 10 to 16 because it is still a romance novel, but not what you call a trashy romance novel. It is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels.

review/text: Tess Lindsey has lived on the remote island of Isle of May and has been raised by the only two other people who lived on the island, all the time uncertain of who she is and her true identity. After the death of her caretakers, she is left on the island all by herself and must do battle alone. That is until one day she rescues a stranger---a stranger who also holds her questions of her past in his very hands. Colin MacPherson has the knack for adventure and a beautiful girl at every single place he visits, that is until he meets Tess...a strong-willed girl that intrigues him at every turn. As the two form a bonding trust Colin begins to piece together the clues of Tess's mysterious past...and a future that most likely will not include him. This definitely has to be one of the best Avon True Romances so far, after Anna and the Duke. I didn't expect it to be this good so it really took me by surprise. Every teenage girl who loves romance should read this book!

review/text: The plot and outline was good, just the writing needed a bit of work. Things were repeated over and over through out the story and became redundant. Talk of children playing with dogs and such. Also there wasn't a good transition in Tess's attitude. She is weepy and scared, but when she gets there she is couragous, makes a speech and confronts a steward? This was okay, but other Avon True Romance books are better. Nicola and the Viscount, and Anna and the Duke being my favorites.

review/summary: good romance for teens
review/text: Tess is alone. For eleven years, an elderly couple raised her after finding her at six, alone and frightened, amongst the rocks on the shoreline of the island they keep. Now, though, Tess' guardians have died, leaving Tess to tend to the island and, as per their orders, hide whenever someone new comes there. When she finds a handsome young Highlander washed up on the shores of her island, she knows she must help him or he will die.As Tess and the handsome Highlander, Colin, spend time together waiting for a ship to come take him home, they form a friendship and discover that Tess is not so alone in the world as she thinks.This was a cute story, and definitely better than the last Avon True Romance (for teens) I picked up. It's the type of thing I would have swooned over as a teenager, had I deigned to read romances at that age (I admit, I had a bit of book snobbery going on, though I secretly loved any romance I could find in books I read). As an adult, now, I read the book and think it's cute. I would have loved to have seen how Tess and Colin's relationship matures as they do, but that is beyond the scope of this book and the age range it is intended for. I will probably be searching out McGoldrick's adult romance novels, though, given the promise this one held.

review/text: Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book.

They are pretty decent pants but just one addition would make these pants a five,if they added the adjustable waist band feature that most of the pants her size have(the one with stretch and a button inside the waist band). Other than this one suggestion they wash and wear well.

review/summary: Top class CD, but a little too long
review/text: Coming at this CD as a complete novice to Drum and Bass music, it was totally mind blowing. At last a band that could use the techniques to make a complete album. The music mixes up a variety of dance and jazz to produce a superb sound, that is both good for listening and dancing to. Kelly, the lead singer, has one of the best female voices I have heard. Her voice is both passionate and soft, but she brings a down to earth feel to every word.Unfortunately the Album is too long and like many Drum and Bass (or Dance) albums there are, as call them, filler tracks, beats and sounds that could have been used to make a complete tune. These filler tracks sound like overlong intros. I have resorted to writing down the tracks I want to listen too, so I can program my cd player.The Album moves on from their earlier stuff and produces a new style of sound with a retro feel.However no matter how many filler tracks are on this album it is definaitely worth having.Well done to E-Z rollers, look forward to the next album

review/text: This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it.

review/summary: Great starting point
review/text: This book contains a great amount of vocabulary. It teaches you the Anglicized versions of certain words such as "teacher" but it also gives you the Yoruba word. Although I didn't appreciate the Anglicized words at first, they are good to know because a lot of people use them. The CD is an excellent and necessary addition to the book. There are lots of dialogues and lists of vocabulary on them (there are 2 CDs). The CD does skip over some of the exercises in the book, which I guess you're supposed to go over by yourself or with a teacher, though. All in all, it's a great set and, if mastered, can bring the user to a high level of fluency. I also like that the narrator, who speaks English to announce the lessons, is a native speaker and doesn't butcher the names of the characters in the dialogues. There is a Yoruba book/CD set created by another publisher who uses a British narrator. It really throws you off course throughout the CD. Watch out for that one and buy this one instead!

review/text: I agree, the CDs are a much needed help, since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker. However, the design of the book is really poor and confusing. I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba. And the grammar explanations are very hard to understand.Unfortunately there are not many Teach Yourself Yoruba books that are worth it. This one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills.

The companion CDs that come with this book are simply outstanding. I especially enjoy the fact that the book is respectful of ALL religions.As an update after using the CDs for a few weeks, it is true that the speaker who speaks fastest on the CD does make many mistakes. I noted errors on greetings. These are rather odd to say the least. However, I still think this is a great source! My toddler is learning right along with me and she demands I play the CD everyday! As we repeat phrases, I simply correct the errors. I really appreciate the different participants on the CD and the dialogues which are authentic and properly contextualize the vocabulary.The phrase "O'ngbiyanju" is priceless!

review/summary: Super fun!
review/text: This tic-tac-toe take-off is extremely fun. Don't let the "JR" fool you. It is simple enough for my 5YO yet challenging enough for any adult. Each player gets 6 "gobblets" (2 small, 2 med, and 2 lg) to play with. We learned very quickly that part of the strategy is figuring out which size pieces to play first, but it is also important not to just "gobble" each other up since it is easy to gobble to the point where each player has just two spaces on the board. Since "gobbling" is so much fun it is hard to resist over-gobbling.This is a top-notch game, very fun to play. The gameboard and pieces are all wooden and attractively decorated. Even the box is very sturdy. This is a fun and welcome addition to our collection.

review/text: This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too.

review/summary: Fun, simple game but challenging enough for adults
review/text: I like that kids can beat adults at this game. It's like tic tac toe but in an advanced way. It's simple enough that my 4-year-old takes a try with this (not so successfully but with a lot of fun and enthusiasim) and my 7-year-old definitely plays this well. You have to watch your moves carefully because your pieces can be covered by an opponent's piece easily (and with tic-tac-toe you don't get to cover someone's space once they've played on it, so this can be a tricky addition to the game.)Friends introduced us to this game one weekend and within 2 days I ran out and bought it myself. Easy to travel with as well...you can just pile up the pieces in a small bag and leave the wood board at home. When you get where you're going, it's easy to create the board with a piece of paper and pencil (just like a tic tac toe board.)This is a good gift item as well. Not as many people have this at home so it's one you can feel safe in buying and giving to someone as a little something unexpected. We've ordered a few as gifts and have fun teaching the game to others.

It is just like tic-tac-toe, but you can eat up your opponent's pieces with your own larger pieces. It is a game of strategy. My 7 year old enjoys beating her 17 year old cousins in this game, before they figure out how to do it. My 5 year old can beat his cousins as well. I would recommend it.

review/summary: great teaching tool but not a great game
review/text: This is a good pure strategy game but it has one defect that limits it for older players. The Original Gobblet is 4x4 and is a fun complex sophisticated strategy game, but it's also a long game not suited to 6 year olds just getting started in board games. Gobblet Junior looked like great idea when I bought it. 3x3 meant games would end quickly but teach the basic stategy. Perfect for a 6 year old.The problem is that the person who goes first can force the win. This force is not perfectly simple as it not a pre-determined set of moves but is rather like a predetermined set of responses. So if you can memorize chess openings or checker openings then you can always win this game.The good news is that until the child comes to realize this and seek tat solution it is a good game a teaching how to think several moves ahead. it is fun. But eventually one realizes it is a won game and a lot of the fascination is lost. So it's good training for many month, then you need to buy a 4x4.

review/summary: Kelly Club Pet Parade at HIT!! My Daughter Loves IT!!
review/text: My 4 year old daughter LOVES this game. She sings the "Strike Up The Band and Clap Your Hands for Kelly's Pet Parade!" song around the house. She can dress the Kelly kids, "train" each pet (teach the pony to jump, etc.), clean and get the animals ready for the parade (paint the elephant's toe nails, etc.), and decorate the floats...all by herself. She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse.

review/summary: I was voted "favorite aunt" by my 3-year-old niece!
review/text: Apparently this is about the best $... I have spent lately (aside from the Gameboy game I sent my nephew). My niece is mesmorized by this game, and it is keeping my sister busy building parades. My niece is a little too young to run this program by herself, but she has definitely figured out what button needs to be pushed to make the parade start! My sister also told me that she likes the fact that you can save multiple parades for those days when she just doesn't have time to help create a new one. This seems to be a winner!

review/summary: Fabulous!!!
review/text: After doing alot of researching and reading reviews I purchased Kelly's Pet Parade and it is fabulous.My four year old daughter has has no problems playing it without any supervision. Ability to use the mouse is important.She can keep the different activities as simple or as elaborate as she wants to.When you want to do a new parade you have to use a different name (susie2 etc.) or erase the saved parade.The whole thing is just darling and fun to play. My daughter has to do 30 minutes of a math or alphabet game before she can play Kelly's Pet Parade. So, she likes it so much that using it as a reward has worked.

review/summary: Daughter LOVES this game!
review/text: Lately, my 4 year old daughter has been obsessed with computer games. I'm buying more games on CDs to decrease her exposure to the internet. She loves animals so I figured this would at least be mildly interesting. That turned out to be an understatement. She fell in love with it instantly.There are four characters in the game and each has an animal friend. To play the game, you have to prepare each character and their animal for a pet parade by teaching the animal a trick, picking out clothes for the character, and designing a float for each pair. After each pair and their float is ready for the parade, you have to organize the parade and add special effects. Then, you start the parade and the program plays out the parade that you designed. The parade is actually pretty brief, but it can be played over and over as many times as you like.The game can be quickly mastered by most children but has enough variety to encourage them to go back to repeat the tasks many times. There are a variety of clothing choices and float options. Even though it seems repetitious to me, my daughter doesn't seem to mind it - and she's very advanced with computer use. I've also noticed that when she goes back over and over to play the games where she teaches the animals their tricks for a specific parade, the game increases in difficulty so it's not monotonous. There are also several options for printables, including a cute friendship bracelet with your child's name on it.This game certainly would not qualify as educational, although it does build good computer skills and hand/eye coordination. Overall, I would say it's just good, clean fun.I gave this four stars because sometimes the program seems a little slow and there is a delay between screen changes. Also, you can't play the game without the CD in the disk drive, even after fully loading the game on the computer. This is a negative to me because for most kids, you would have to assist them with starting the game. However, my 4 year old has pretty much mastered inserting the CD, closing the drive drawer, and clicking on the program icon. I'm just not totally comfortable with her doing it when I'm not there. The last thing I need is to have a broken CD jammed in my computer...

review/text: Don't usually purchase shoes without trying them on first and I should have stuck with my rule. They are advertised as a Wide, but actually they didn't feel like it. The quality of the shoe is Wonderful and the shoe is really cute. I think it would be great for the average foot. I'm wondering since they put elastic in the shoe, that's what they considered "wide". Since I wore it once, I probably can't return it. If you have a regular width foot, I'd order this. Cute shoe!

review/summary: Much more sensible than most books critical of the field.
review/text: This is not the first book I've read that is critical of psychiatry. But compared to Caplan, Breggin, and Szasz, this is the most sensible critique I've seen. Usually, in the anti-psychiatry literature one finds inexcusible nonsequiturs. For example: "Psychiatrists often don't realize that the medication is causing the disorder (good point). Therefore, biological psychatry is unsound (bad point)." Or "Psychiatric illnesses are voted on by committee (good point), therefore there is no such thing as mental illness (bad point)." Walker avoids making such obvious nonsequiturs. Far from being against biological psychiatry, Walker argues that current psychiatry is not biological enough. It appeals to highly hypothetical conditions (such as neurotransmitter disorders) while ignoring known conditions (such as pin worms or hypothyroidism). Some might think that this is all that Walker is saying, but his general point seems to be that since psychiatrists are taught to run through symptoms lists instead of being medical detectives, there a lot of unknown conditions which they are failing to discover.

review/summary: Fascinating and Terrifying
review/text: Dr. Walker's book is a stern indictment of the contemporary medical profession and the mental health field in particular. He charges the majority of psychiatrists of ignoring the true needs of their patients and instead practicing and arbitrary pseudo-science of labeling. They seem to have given up on the idea (fundamental to the philosophy of science)that all events have a cause and that to understand something we must understand the process of cause and effect that brought it into being. Most modern psychiatrists are not interested in finding out what is wrong through careful methodology. They are divided into two camps. The psychoanalytic types deny a medical cause for abnormal feelings and behaviour altogether (however, they still want the prestige that comes with being a medical doctor!). They look everything from a bad childhood to alien abductions to explain such things as psychosis and manic depression, even though no scientific study has ever proven the theories on which their claims are based. The next group, the standard issue biopsychiatrists are a little more up to date. They would admit the obvious scientific truth that someone who hears voices or is immobilized by a deep depression is psysically ill. However, they drop the ball as well. Most biologically based psychiatrists give very vague answers about the causes of mental illness, and rely on a few biological treatments which are tried on the patient almost randomly until one seems to &quot;work&quot;. For instance, a depressed person will be given one antidepressant drug after another without the doctor even stopping to consider that the deprssion may result from anemia, a thyroid imbalance, poor nutrition or a host of other causes. Many psyciatric patients today are not even given a blood test, an EEG or any other genuine medical test before traetment is prescribed. Walker points out that until people are given a battery of tests, we will never really know what is wrong with them. Prozac or tranquilizers may make the! m feel better temporatily, but they could be literally dying. He also attacks the concepts of hypochodndria and facetious disorder. For the most part, he argues, these are destructive labels used to protect doctors and stigmatized patients (&quot;if I can't figure out what is wrong with you then it is all in you're head and/or you are just making it up&quot;) While I don't agree with all his points (for instance, his extreme anti-prozac position) I must say that this book is must reading for anyone in need of mental health care.

review/summary: Informative, but left me wanting more
review/text: I was very impressed with A Dose of Sanity because so many books critical of psychiatry remind me of Breggin which claim that there is something &quot;spiritual&quot; missing in the patient, and the author ignores the bioligical problems inherent in the behavioral or mood disorder.However, I as I made my way through the book I was concerned that Dr. Walker was not going to address what to do if you have been diagnosed with a serious mood disorder, but were unable to find a physical cause (like a boy that was ADHD but had cardiac problems). I was right. He never said what to do if you have been diagnosed with manic depression (or any of the other hard to treat mood disorders). He did not address lithium or other non-antidepressant therapies for mood disorders. I agree that these treatments are probably only treating the symptoms of some underlying brain dysfunction that science has not yet named, but what does the patient do until science has figured this out? Remain psychotic? Lithium therapy may be some band-aid solution for a cellular dysfunction of our brain matter, but is a patient supposed to discontinue this medication because science can only offer this treatment to help the symptoms of the disorder? I wish Walker had offered an opinion and information on this issue.Also, along the same line, he didn't say what patients should do once they had gone through exstensive medical testing to determine their problem and nothing physically wrong was found. (Nevermind the fact that he did't give specific tests to ask for - just blood and urinalysis in addition to what else?) If you know that you don't suffer from pin worms, syphillis, typhus, cardiac problems or whatever else, but your symptoms only seem to match typical manic symptoms that only lithium helps, should you throw in the towel and accept the psychotropic medication?I do think that Dr. Walker is truly concerned about patients who have fallen victim to DSM &quot;diagnosis&quot;, and this book could be very helpful for a patient who has received psychiatric care, but did not have a full medical work-up before taking psychotropic medications. I only wish this book had touched on the issues that I mentioned above.Finally, the most important message of this book is never stop learning about what you have been told your disorder is, and never take the word of your doctor as law. As Walker says himself, there is no way that one doctor can know everthing about medicine.

review/summary: Somatic medicine as an alternative to psychiatry?
review/text: Walker's book rests on two main themes. One is that theDSM, in spite of its name, is not a diagnostic manual at all, but a catalogue of descriptive labels that serve as an excuse for abandoning further medical investigation. He calls the DSM "a cookbook listing of symptoms that has replaced the science of differential diagnosis."The other theme divides into two parts. The minor one is that many people who are slapped with DSM labels and prescribed psychotropic drugs have nothing at all medically wrong with them.The major theme, however, and the main theme of the book next to criticism of the DSM, is that almost all cases of serious aberrations of feelings or behavior stem from physical causes such as genetic disease, hormonal imbalances, toxins, infection, parasites, and tumors. The DSM encourages psychiatrists to be lazy and overlook these causes, he says. Psychotropic drugs only mask them, and do more harm than good. Psychotherapy, including psychoanalysis, are totally useless for these conditions. Psychiatry should return to its true mission as practiced (according to Walker) by Emil Kraepelin and Benjamin Rush, namely to identify and treat the physical causes of insanity.I agree with Walker that cases of grossly aberrant behavior (as opposed to responses to stress) are probably due to unidentified physical causes. However, not identifying these causes is the failure of somatic medicine, not psychiatry. Psychiatry's mission has always been to sweep up after somatic medicine, and to sweep away society's rejects while it's at it.Walker maintains that there is a legitimate use of psychotropic drugs, but only in those extremely rare cases that the physical cause cannot be identified, or no curative treatment exists. My opposition to this contention is that far from being extremely rare, those are exactly all cases with which psychiatry deals. One of Walker's examples of physical disease which psychiatrists frequently fail to identify and treat is Tourette Syndrome, which he calls genetic. In spite of his own insistence that the causes of conditions should be scientifically sought, he fails to provide any evidence that TS is genetic in origin. Even if he had such evidence, since when does identifying conditions as genetic make them curable? On the other hand, Walker overlooks compelling evidence that TS is caused by brain damage: it is common in people whose brains have been damaged by psychotropic drugs. He doesn't mention how he thinks TS should be treated. In fact, the only "treatment" that exists, whether effective or not, is Haldol, the very type of treatment he claims to oppose except in those extremely rare cases, whichever they are.While correctly calling into question the efficacy and safety of psychiatric practice, Walker highly overrates somatic medicine. He attaches great diagnostic significance to gene mapping and brain scanning, whereas in reality such toys have as yet benefited no one but the doctors who employ them for research.One of Walker's more bombastic claims for successful treatment of aberrant behavior is ... surgically cleaning cholesterol out of a patient's brain arteries! (Who would be so gullible as to believe that?)Interesting to note are Walker's views on two of the greats among opponents to psychiatry, Peter Breggin and Thomas Szasz.Walker duly credits Breggin with having called attention to the horrific harm done by psychiatric drugs. Unfortunately, according to Walker (and I agree with him on this) the flip side to Breggin is blaming serious dysfunctional behavior on "bad parenting." No, not such obvious bad parenting as battering children or trading them for cocaine, but vague failures that only Breggin himself can identify, like paying insufficient attention to children. Walker might have added that those parents who are likely to seek psychiatric services, not to mention pay big bucks for them (a subject on which Breggin never touches), are the very parents who are deeply devoted to their children. Walker also criticizes Breggin for blaming schools, though schools are very much known to contribute to the ill-being of children.Contrary to his position on Breggin, Walker showers praise on Szasz, particularly for having been the first and the most relentless critic of DSM fake diagnoses. However, he feels Szasz goes too far in denying there is ever a physical origin for dysfunctional behavior, and by suggesting that such people are actually "incompetent, lazy, or bad." He presumes that Szasz would leave them to die in the streets and in jails, overlooking the fact that Szasz is the only writer in the field who has suggested a practical solution for dealing with such people, namely the non-medical asylum, or as Szasz nicknames it, the "adult orphanage."Those of you who are interested in "alternative psychiatry" may be interested in Walker's views on such treatments. He does not reject the idea outright, though he considers most of them quackery and downright silly. Acupuncture he calls effective in treating pain - but not curing the cause of pain.Orthomolecular medicinecan treat nutritional deficiency, but nothing else, he says.Walker further criticizes judges' reliance on psychiatric expertise. He says nothing about it that Szasz hasn't said before him. He does not mention involuntary commitment anywhere in the book.Finally, Walker calls on us, potential psychiatric patients, to take responsibility for our own health care. That's fine advice, but limited by the fact that responsibility can be carried out only in freedom. Massive state intervention in medicine means that much of his otherwise excellent advice is impossible to follow.All in all, this book's power is the author's ability to state in layman's language why theDSMis a fraud.Copyright MeTZelf

The closest thing to another Dr.Walker in Canada might be the ill-fated Dr.Ed Pakes,a brilliant pioneer bereavement psychiatrist. There is also Dr.Robin Brooks-Hill. Then there is an aloof South African &quot;Shrink&quot;,and his son,who wrote some book called &quot;Freud&quot;. (Obviously that isn't really the correct title,but it is a free country) Besides,why see Dr.Aloof Shrink when you can watch Meryl Streep films on Video.

review/summary: The Fabulous Miss Gloria Lynne!!!
review/text: Gloria Lynne has one of the most beautiful and distinct voices I have ever heard. Her voice is as plush as velvet and as sweet as honey. I consider her to be one of the few real divas left from the old school, members of which include Dinah Washington, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn, Nancy Wilson, and Betty Carter (sorry if I may have left out any of your personal favorites).Every song on this album is excellent, along with the jazzy orchestration, which is probably why it was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1990. Gloria gives a freshness to "He's Out Of My Life", almost making it a new song. The mellow sound of "You Keep Turning Me On," is reminiscent of the small jazz clubs where the singer knows many of the audience members by name. The title song "A Time For Love", shows off Gloria's early classical training and withstands the test of time. Her jazzier side is highlighted in the tune "But Beautiful" and "Love Is Blind." Gloria knows how to sing all types of music and her blues like approach to "Trust In Me" is heartwrenching yet warming. Her delivery of "I Thought About You", and "Come Get Your Share" is light and whimsical and makes you feel happy all over. Of course you can't go wrong in ending such a splendid album with the old favorite "I'm In The Mood For Love', and I think after listening to this album we all will be in the mood!!This Album is a winner for me!!!!!

review/summary: Smoldering passionate vocals~Bravo Gloria Lynne!
review/text: "A Time For Love" is clearly time for Gloria Lynne and this superb collection is an inspired musical celebration by an extraordinary singer, Gloria Lynne just gets better as time goes by. "He's Out Of My Life" is magically haunting as Miss Lynne smolders in this timeless classic that sticks with you long after it is over. Finding a funky groove in "You Keep On Turnin' Me On" creates a real cooker while "A Time For Love" becomes a torchy masterpiece and definitive version of the classic from motion picture "Romeo And Juliet". No less than three great self-penned songs show Gloria Lynne is musical through and through with "Lend Me Yesterday" exotic and haunting sounding like a great standard flowing well with other classics in this wondrous set. "But Beautiful" is hauntingly gorgeous and "Trust In Me" is a soulfully sung beautiful version of another timeless classic. Gloria and guitar make "Love Is Blind" a stunning ballad and a jazzy "I Thought About You" is sublime never sounding quite like it does here. The last Gloria Lynne original is a real cooker with Gloria turning "Come Get Your Share" inside out. As in most great works the best is saved for the finale and the stunning "I'm In The Mood For Love" is quite simply glorious. Tremendous collection is a "must have" for anyone who loves The Art Of Great Singing at a sublime peak....get this masterful collection fast while available! Bravo to you Gloria Lynne and your wonderfully gifted and greatly inspired musicans...

review/summary: This music is my addiction
review/text: What can I say? I spend an average of at least fifteen dollars a week playing this game for many reasons. Not only do I get a complete workout, the music just rawks my sawks. That's why I decided I had to throw in my two cents about this CD.I ordered this CD like, a few days ago. I can't wait to get it. This CD is one you can listen to for hours at a time, while never getting tired of the songs. I'm hooked on Dam Dariram and Upside Down [they're also fun to dance to at the arcade], while my friend is hooked to Butterfly, Boom Boom Dollar, and La Senorita. The music... is amazing. This is like, a worthwhile buy for anyone who likes to dance.I've been playing the DDR 3rd Mix Arcade Game for nearly three weeks now, and I haven't gotten tired of the music at all. I'm addicted. The game's fun, but the music's better!I am, as many may know, a rock fan. A lot of people wonder how I ever got into this kind of music, it doesn't fit my 'personality'. Just one listen of this CD will prove you otherwise, it is worth hearing for anyone. Anyone, I bet you, will find something on the CD worth liking.I loved 'So Many Men' because it has this slow beat that I can have fun with. Scott loves 'Butterfly Upswing Mix' because not only does it give you a good workout [on the arcade game], the song is addictive, and you can even sing along, too! 'La Senorita' has that Latin beat that gets your hips moving, and Paranoia infuses your entire body with energy, you have to wonder how can you NOT dance to it.All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this CD to anyone who knows their music, and loves to add a special CD to their collection. I know, for a fact, that this CD will not be leaving my CD player for at least six months... at least.

review/text: This cd is soooo cool. Especially the non-stop megamix the transitions are perfect, but you could be annoyed by the constant voice of the announcer. Some of what he says is very corny but you should be able to live with it (Especially when you're playing the actual game). All in all it's a great CD and a great buy.

review/text: If one were interested in my reviews he would see that the few I have have laid towards the negative. Not the case here. Third Mix is the king of all DDR, with all songs being somewhat speedy and having a good beat (5 or so don't) this soundtrack is tight. This one is actually worth 50.00, forget any other soundtrack.

review/text: I originally purchased this soundtrack from an importer when I heard it was coming out. And I was far from disappointed. It quickly replaced the 2nd Mix soundtrack that hardly left my CD player.This soundtrack collects the songs from the incredibly popular dancing game of the same name. It's huge over in Japan, where they're almost ready to release the 5th mix of the game, and thankfully it's finally finding its own here in the states. The soundtrack features import stars, as well as American type artists like Technotronic and Chumbawumba.And as always, the non-stop mega-mix CD provides a sweet party CD when you don't want to worry about changing the music. Trust me, as far as dance music goes, you won't be disappointed.Now if you excuse me, I have to go listen to my 4th mix soundtrack that just showed up in the mail.

review/text: The songs on DISC 1 are not the full versions, they are the game versions of the songs.You get the whole soundtrack here, PLUS you get hits from 2nd mix as well.Disc 2 is a remix of all the tracks, and they are mixed beautifully. You can put Disc 2 in and have a dance party. They really spent a lot of time mixing the songs. Also, on Disc 2 some songs are longer than the version in the arcade, so you get to hear more of certain songs.I highly recommend this CD to any DDR fan.

I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them.

review/summary: WHAT GREAT NATIONS AND COUNTRY MUSIC IS MADE OF
review/text: Thematically, Letters From Home is similar to Tracy Lawrence's Strong. Both focus on the importance of family, home, and life as it is lived on the human scale over against the larger concerns of the outside world. Neither one claims that the affairs of the world "don't amount up to a hill of beans compared to you and me, baby"; but they do remind in this post-911 world that family and home are what it's all about.Unlike Lawrence, Montgomery is more treasured as "the voice". Vocally, he is more a baritone than a tenor and is more soothing to the ears-a little more "western" and "cowboy" sometimes. Montgomery also is more known for some plainly sentimental songs in the past such as "I Love the Way You Love Me" and "I Can Love You Like That". He has a special attraction, many woman claim, because he can sing tenderly and tug at the heartstrings. This can backfire on any artist because if he does this too often he will soon not be taken seriously. And Montgomery has teetered close to the edge several times in his career.Lawrence's Strong dealt with the refuge of family and home and the dangers that could take it all away. Montgomery chooses to focus more on the human ties that make up this sanctuary.The CD begins with a particularly "southern" interest in "Good Ground". The song runs at a fair clip in country rock fashion. One can wonder at the value of a bunch of dirt beyond what it can do for crops but the singer isn't talking about agriculture. It is about a sense of "place" and how home nurtures life and is the scene where children and families gather the wealth of experience and affection to live life."Letters From Home" (the first single) is a moderately "walking" tune about the things family members say to soldier children who are in dangerous places far away. Sometimes it is when we are afraid we will lose them we finally say what it is we want them to know. It is simple and suggestive-imagine it is a popular but difficult song to hear if you are a soldier or Marine in Afghanistan or Iraq."That's What I'm Talking About" celebrates to joys of a man and a woman. "Look At Me Now" is an object lesson about "I did everything right but I got it all wrong". The song is open to interpretation; but "you see, all that I've done doesn't matter at all/ it's what I leave here when I'm gone" suggests that the family the singer did not have on the path to success was the "pearl of great price" he foolishly did not grasp."Goes Good With Beer" is a little bit of comic relief and every bit the good-timey country tune it sounds like. A song that champions the pleasure of life in a world of trouble, it surely will be an upcoming popular hit."Cool" runs over the same theme as Kenny Chesney's "There Goes My Life" from the viewpoint of a son who doesn't understand why his dad isn't more "with it". Some may complain that it is just an "anti-abortion" song. It is every bit of that; but it is more about a man who holds to honor and obligation rather than the fashion of the day."It Rocked" is the closest Montgomery gets to an outright rock song. Again, it harks back to the country/rock sound of the 1970's; but it swings. Like "That Changes Everything" that follows it, it is about the personal anchors in life that keep us grounded and make life meaningful."Break This Chain" is about getting away from what gets between us and the ones we love. "Little Devil" seems a little out of place except as a light and fun end to some serious stuff. After all, the mild mannered girl the singer wants to skinny dip with in the Jacuzzi could be just a one-night stand for all we know. No one says it's his wife or girlfriend. And the sly little "this can be our little secret/we don't have to tell no one" is undoubtedly suggestive. But this is country music! We can't all be so solemn and dead serious all the time. Besides, some of the best families come out of an indecent skinny dip.Home. Hearth. Family. Sex. These are things that make a great nation. In this case, they also make a great CD.

review/text: I admit that I bought this album for the title track alone. After all, had that been the only good track on this CD I still would have felt that it was worth my money.But the title track is just the beginning for this fine country offering by John Michael Montgomery. I found myself listening to and enjoying every track on LETTERS FROM HOME. Montgomery's smoother-than-silk voice is one of the finest in country music today and his straight-forward approach to his music comes through in every note. You won't want to miss this one.THE HORSEMAN

review/summary: A good, solid country music album!
review/text: John Michael Montgomery has asserted himself as a radio mainstay in the nineties. Though he got little airplay since then--"The Little Girl" is the only hit I can think of--this album promises to deliver him back into the spotlight. He has left behind the twang of his previous efforts, and has chosen a good selection of substantial, well-written and BELIEVEABLE material.LETTERS begins with "Good Ground," an uptempo number about family and love that continues on most of the other songs. The title track is a gut-wrenching number (admit it, you had a tear in your eye when you first heard it) that indeed stands out, but is not the only good tune on here. "Look At Me Now" is a confessional number about growing older, while "Cool" deals with the consequences faced in life."That's What I'm Talkin About" is a romp that manages to skewer gossipers AND contain suggestive lyrics (a similar vein is followed on "Little Devil"). "Goes Good With Beer" is destined to become a honky-tonk classic, while "Break This Chain" is pretty much it's opposite--the story of a man from a long line of alcoholics praying for the strenght to defeat his curse. "That Changes Everything" shows us the surprise directions life can take, while "It Rocked" lets us know that life's greatest moments and sensations come from the simple things.LETTERS FROM HOME is easily John Michael Montgomery's best album. While Montgomery has situated himself as frontman for radio-friendly music (ironically, big-brother Eddie is doing the same thing for outlaw country), he shows us that he does indeed know what a good country song is about...His voice is neither world-class nor run-of-the-mill, but he uses it for all it's worth, and it's worth a pretty penny. LETTERS FROM HOME will make you cry, make you laugh, make you sing, and even--if you're really in the mood--make you dance. A great album by one of today's best performers.

review/summary: Heartfelt &quot;Letters&quot;
review/text: Prime Cuts: Cool, Letters from Home, That Changes EverythingMusically, the family resemblance between John Michael and brother Eddie of Montgomery Gentry fame runs thin. While Eddie Montgomery is a heel kicking honky tonk troubadour, John Michael is the personification of gentility. While Montgomery Gentry has blasted the speakers of country radio with defiant anthems like "She Couldn't Change Me" and "Hell Yeah," big brother Montgomery sings about roping the moon and covering his significant other with kisses.Not surprisingly, nostalgia, sentimentality and introspection earmarked John Michael's latest album "Letters from Home." In fact, other than a few rollicking honky tonk numbers, most of "Letters from Home" deal with the affairs of the heart. Best of which is the excellent title cut as well as lead off single, "Letters from Home." Riding along some gentle guitar picking and plaintive sounding dobro, Montgomery sings about a G.I. savoring correspondence from his parents and loved ones while being far away from home. An engaging number that has done its share of currying favor with country radio, "Letters from Home" finds Montgomery back into the top 10 terrain after a 4 year hiatus. Less poignant, but equally sentimental is the amicable "Look at Me Now."Ultra cool is Harley Allen and Brice Long's ballad "Cool"--- a cautionary tale of a father warning his rebellious teenager to take stock of his rowdy ways for what goes around comes around. Replete with some fine fiddling, Montgomery's performance on "Cool" is nothing less than stellar--sincere, reflective and entrancing. Though "Cool" first appeared on Montgomery's previous greatest hits collection, it's such a standout that I was glad it got revived. Paternal fidelity is also the theme of the album's opener "Good Ground." Though set at a faster tempo with some big booming drums, it's one of the most country efforts Montgomery has tackled in a while.Billy Yates and Jim Collins' "Break This Chain" is another superb country offering. Almost delivered as a prayer, "Break This Chain" expresses the desperate plea of an alcoholic for deliverance for the sake of his family. To my ears, this is one of the most moving tear jerker I have had heard in a while. Nevertheless, not all is sad. The hopeless romantic can put their fainting heart to ease: "That Changes Everything," penned by David Lee and Tony Lane (who were also responsible for crafting the title cut) is a gentle yet beautiful ballad extolling love's power to "change everything."However, not everything works here. Montgomery's sensitivity can work against him when the material is not right. I find Paul Overstreet and Marty Dodson's "It Rocked" excruciatingly sappy. "It Rocked" celebrates the milestones of life: first love, first car, first job.... Come on, I think this is a little too maudlin! I am already starting to get a tooth ache, it's just too sugary. I am sure Montgomery or/and producer Bryon Gallimore must have felt that way too. So, to boost Montgomery's machismo, we have the propulsive honky tonk number "Goes Good With Beer." With Montgomery's crisp free suit and his family man image portrayed in the other songs, I find it hard to believe when Montgomery sings about hanging with his crazy buddies and those "pretty girls" in a smoke filled tavern as he professes in "Goes Good With Beer." A tad more believable is the funky yet somehow raunchy "Little Devil"-though "Little Devil" sounds like a recycle of Montgomery's number 1 hit, "Be My Baby Tonight."Aside from these few detours, "Letters from Home," as the title suggests, appeals to the heart. With country radio's incessant appetite for heart tugging tunes, "Letters from Home" could easily be one of Montgomery's most radio friendly albums. In fact, I believe this album is hued with chart hits. This is a much welcomed return to form for Montgomery.

"goes good with beer" is the type of song that will be a well known sing along if it gets released to radio.

review/summary: One of 2004's best commercial country albums
review/text: Of the flood of post-September 11 patriotic tunes, few have reached the lyrical heights of Alan Jackson's &quot;Where Were You,&quot; and in general most songs in the ouvre have been clumsy and ham-fisted, stuff like Toby Keith's oafish and embarrassingly bad &quot;Courtesy Of The Red, White &amp; Blue&quot; and &quot;American Soldier&quot; or Daryll Worley's catchy but poorly reasoned &quot;Do You Remember,&quot; songs that seek to persuade or score points in the ongoing cultural turf war back on the homefront. In contrast, this album's title track, Tony Lane and David Lee's &quot;Letters From Home,&quot; transcends the politics of the moment with an understated, emotionally resonant, well-crafted portrait of a soldier at war whose crushing daily regime is lightened by news from the folks back home. By not mentioning Saddam or Osama, the song retains a timelessness, speaking to the hardships and determination of soldiers in general, not just those send abroad in the Bush years, and its rise to the top of the charts is quite justly deserved. Though not as powerful as the single, the rest of the album is also pretty good -- on the very next track, Montgomery mentions seeing the war on the evening news, but lapses into escapism and the comfort of baby's arms. On the whole, though, singing one great song with such emotional power ain't bad, and fans who buy this album just on the strength of that track alone will not be disappointed by the rest of the disc.

review/text: Of the flood of post-September 11 patriotic tunes, few have reached the lyrical heights of Alan Jackson's &quot;Where Were You,&quot; and in general most songs in the ouvre have been clumsy and ham-fisted, stuff like Toby Keith's oafish and embarrassingly bad &quot;Courtesy Of The Red, White & Blue&quot; and &quot;American Soldier&quot; or Daryll Worley's catchy but poorly reasoned &quot;Do You Remember,&quot; songs that seek to persuade or score points in the ongoing cultural turf war back on the homefront. In contrast, this album's title track, Tony Lane and David Lee's &quot;Letters From Home,&quot; transcends the politics of the moment with an understated, emotionally resonant, well-crafted portrait of a soldier at war whose crushing daily regime is lightened by news from the folks back home. By not mentioning Saddam or Osama, the song retains a timelessness, speaking to the hardships and determination of soldiers in general, not just those send abroad in the Bush years, and its rise to the top of the charts is quite justly deserved. Though not as powerful as the single, the rest of the album is also pretty good -- on the very next track, Montgomery mentions seeing the war on the evening news, but lapses into escapism and the comfort of baby's arms. On the whole, though, singing one great song with such emotional power ain't bad, and fans who buy this album just on the strength of that track alone will not be disappointed by the rest of the disc.

review/text: Great Toy, hard to find! We get ours online here or shipped from a friend in America!Our little Papillion-Yorkie mix loves it. Every night I am in the back garden kicking the ball for him! He destroys tennis balls by chewing off the fluff and our wee dog finds them to big to carry/catch. We stumbled across this in our local petstore and our dog was hooked! Sadly, local pet store no longer imports them.Stars all around for this one!

review/summary: King James Scores!
review/text: Ryan Jones is a great basketball writer. In King James: The LeBron James Story he does a great job of trying to show the reader how amazingly good LeBron James is at basketball. Coach Bob Gibbons said about LeBron's performance in the Olympic trials, "I don't want to blow too much smoke and distort the kid's thinking, but I saw Kobe Bryant in tenth and eleventh grades, and I think this kid is more advanced than Kobe was." Like LeBron, Kobe Bryant was drafted out of high school and has led the Los Angeles Lakers to multiple NBA Championships.Ryan Jones is editor-in-chief at SLAM, the monthly basketball magazine that combined the sport with hip hop culture at a time when the genre was becoming increasingly popular. The magazine carries advertising for basketball-related products, street-wear clothing and hip hop music, and it has been credited with helping to market hip hop culture and basketball as one. It is only fitting that Ryan Jones wrote his first national magazine feature on LeBron James. He thoroughly explains LeBron's involvement with SLAM magazine throughout the book. He lives in New York with his wife and son.Although Jones seems a bit repetitive at times, his knowledge of basketball and great style shines though and creates an easy to read biography. In Chaper Four, he talks about the potential LeBron possessed in football as well as basketball: even though "there wasn't much national buzz on LeBron the football player, area football coaches knew better." Jones even compares him to the New England Patriots Pro-Bowl wideout, Randy Moss. While he mainly focuses on LeBron's basketball ability, his information about LeBron's high school football career is refreshing.With all the hype about LeBron and his constant coverage on ESPN, this book reveals the truth about LeBron and his journey from moving in with his friend's family to his 90 million dollar sneaker deal with Nike. While the vocabulary can be a bit easy at times, the book a joy to read, especially if you are a total sports nut like myself. A stong strength of Jones is to tell the complete story of every little event in Lebron's life. His very descriptive writing explains aspects of basketball that makes this book a good pick for sports lovers and non sports lovers alike. I give this book an eight out of ten and recommend it highly.

review/summary: KING JAMES is awsome
review/text: My story is about LeBron James and how he grew up. When he was a freshman in high school he won tournament MVP for the state, which is amazing.The beginning starts at his childhood and continues so on. My favorite part in the book is when he's a freshman and he played football. Their team made it to state. They lost in the finals, but he got All State. That means hes one of the best in the state. Later that year he made the basketball team. They made it to the state finals. They won and LeBron got MVP. That happened for the next three years.Ryan Jones is a senior editor at SLAM, the monthly basketball magazine. He lives in New York. I would recommend this book to sports fans that like LeBron James. The age and gender I would recommend this book to is ages 13-35 and boys.

review/text: This was a very cool book. It had a ton of great inside stuff I didn't know about The Man. The sneaker stuff was really interesting. Clearly LeBron was under enormous pressure to perform and to do the right thing, and even with the scounts and everything esle going on he gave 100% to his high school team, The Irish. Jones does a great job taking us inside the making of a star.

review/text: This was a AWESOME book. It really looks into the real life of LEBRON JAMES and shows you his trip into stardom. This book is great if you like watching basketball careers grow because is probably the most popular young basketball players in the world today and this book did a really good job of showing how LEBRON is always improving his game. I have read a ton of sports autiobiographies and this one was probably the most inspiring because it took an indept look at the personal and also basketball part of LEBRON JAMES life.

review/text: King James by Ryan Jones is a biography of Lebron's James' life prior to going into the NBA. It tells about how a little kid who lived in poverty with his mother goes on to become a six foot eight inch 245 pound high school basketball superstar. Lebron has to deal with the pressure of the media and go against tough opponents almost every game. Somehow he is able to handle all of this and all the other obstacles in his life. This is an entertaining book to read and I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lebron James or is interested in reading about the rising star. The author does a great job of telling how Lebron is on and off the court. After reading this book you will come to respect Lebron as a basketbal player and a person.

review/summary: The Truth on King James!
review/text: I first heard about Lebron when he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated and followed him ever since. I thought I read a lot about him, but reading this book told me so much that I had never known about Lebron as a player, a person, and all the hype and attention he got from the media, the shoe companies and everyone else. The fact that he dealt with so many distractions and people hating on him and still succeeded was really inspirational. This book has tons of info and quotes from Lebron, and it shows that he seems like a cool guy, too. I would definitely recommend this book if you're a fan of Lebron or just a fan of basketball and sports in general.

review/summary: Yo Homie this is my sweet review
review/text: LeBron James is a basketball hero. He has a big story on how he got to the NBA. LeBron was very poor growing up; his father left him and his mother when he was young. LeBron had to live with friends so his mom could work to keep a roof over their heads. A cool thing I thought LeBron did is when he was signing autographs an adult pushed over a kid just to get LeBrons signature but LeBron said "Let me sign the kids first". I think this shows LeBrons care for kids.When LeBron was in High School at St.Vincent St.Mary, the spotlight was on him. LeBron took the Irish to the state championship all four years of High School. LeBron played Football and Basketball in High School. He could of gone to college to be a star Wide Receiver but he chose Basketball. LeBron won the Mr.Basketball in Ohio award all four years in High School. I loved this book because LeBron never gave up at what he wanted to accomplish. LeaBron is a great role model to young kids because he never gave up and told himself that he could do it. LeBron now is in the NBA and won the Rookie of the Year award.Written by Gerald P. Willamspoon

review/summary: This is an excellent book
review/text: While this book captures the hip sensibilities of SLAM, it's objective is not to be cool. The objective was clearly to tell LeBron James story, and the author does so fluidly and intelligently. The only issue I had when it came out was if LeBron warranted an entire book. Given that he's spent the first three quarters of his rookie season proving he may have even be underrated, consider the book warranted. So, basketball fans, if you want to know the real LeBron James story before it gets changed or distorted by the corporations that are soon to be even more involved in his life, check out this book and you'll get all the background you need to be able to intelligently discuss the first superstar of the new millenium.

review/summary: Overall a very good read
review/text: This was quite an enjoyable read. I was fascinated by the rise and rise of this basketball prodigy due to all the hype surrounding him. There is no doubt that Lebron James is one hell of a talent after seeing many of his highlight plays on T.V, and on the net. This book details his performances in school for ST Vincent-ST Mary and other events, the frenzied interest from fans and media wanting to see him perform, sport commentators and coaches raving about him being the best thing in the sport of basketball, hummergate, speculation about his future career plans, and the fight for his feet between Adidas and Nike in which the latter won because the former could not offer huge amounts of money in the bidding war with its major rival. Great stuff.

review/text: I have to admit that this is a book I never would have thought to purchase given that it would mean reading the bio of an 18 year old kid!!! Still, it was a gift and I have to say that I was very surprised.The book is short (under 200 pgs) and is an easy read. However, I found that a lot of the book read like a magazine article, given that the author usually writes for Slam magazine, this is no surprise. Still, it is interesting and entertaining. I would recommend for fans of Lebron, high school ball, or die-hard hoops fans.

review/text: This cereal is so sweet....yet so good for you! One taste=ADDICTION!!!! I just tried this cereal out of curiousity and I was hooked! It is an excellent breakfast choice, or just any time to eat! Especially as breakfast because you will crave more honey taste and you won't be hungry later {probably because of how much you'd eat} and it is actually sweeter and better than Honey Bunches of Oats. Cap'n Crunch Berries is an option, but this splendid cereal is SO FILLED WITH A HONEY-FILLED TASTE! I have not tried much better tasting cereal than this! Oh!

review/text: Man I love Oh's cereal. It is really great to the last bite, but the size of the box its so small compared to all the other cereals out there. The price is crazy for such a small box...but oh's is one of the best cereals I have ever ever eaten. It keeps me coming back despite the small box, and crazy price. If you never had it you should try it just once. It is wonderful I give it 3 stars only because of the price and how much food you get. If the portions were more fair even for this price it would be five star gold...

review/text: Oh yes. This cereal is delicious. It's O-shaped corn pieces with "good things in the middle", like real oatmeal. This is a Quaker product, after all. The caramel-like taste, which I'd compare to Cap'n Crunch or old school Mr T, Gremlins and Batman cereal, is sweetened with honey, graham (cracker) flour and brown sugar.It's not a good-tasting but a great-tasting cereal, easily one of the best I've ever tried. But; get this; it's too crunchy. No, it wont get soggy in milk, at-least not in any reasonable amount of time, but that's the problem because it makes for a hard chew. If it had the texture and consistency of, say, Cheerios, it'd be perfect.marcellee.com

review/text: The 5 stars is based on 1)the taste which is amazing and 2) the price which is $1.99.HOWEVER there is much to dislike in OH's. They are NOT healthy, in fact they are the only cereal I've seen made with hydrogenated vegetable oil which is basically margarine. The lard will coat your spoon and roof of your mouth and probably arteries with a white oily film that does not rinse off with water alone. It must be diluted in soap and scrubbed.It is captain crunch shaped in a ring with bits in the middle and somehow sweeter and rougher on your mouth. Oh's virgins WILL have bloody pallates if not careful.

review/summary: Great Book...early work on Timber Framing
review/text: This book is one of the classics on Timber Framing for those who want to get into this type of construction or build their own house. It is a very easy read. Though sometimes the author tends towards to much philosophy about life, construction and wood working.This book has very useful sections on joinery, design, raising, engineering, load physics, etc. Very easy to understand even if, like me, you are not a professional carpenter, contractor or mechanical engineer. I know nothing of contracting or building and understood the whole book.The book does not mention anything about Scribe Rule and Square Rule techniques and the differences between the two. These old techniques may not have been widely known when this book was written, although they were well known by early timber frame carpenters, before Timber Framing was replaced with cheaper, but faster Balloon Framing.A book that does go into Square Rule in a more structured way and is equally easy to read is Buid a Classic Timber-Framed House, by Jack Sobon.

review/summary: Nearly three decades old and more relevant than ever
review/text: This book was first written in 1980, though the philosophies presented between its covers are appropriate in these recent years of speculative energy prices and wobbling economic foundations. Timber frame house construction was "green" before that word was media-masticated and spit into popular culture.The book is well illustrated and instructive, and it is also well written. The authors have both experience and passion for this topic. The hand-drawn illustrations are well labeled with a drafting font that makes it interesting and captivating to read.The book begins with a historical review of this art, and slowly drills down to detailed diagrams of the many joining techniques. It is amazing that this old style of construction intuitively solved problems in structural mechanics without the need for finite element modeling, or even nails for that matter. The strength of this method of construction comes not from the size of the timbers (though they are substantial), but from the joints crafted from wood with axes, augers, and hammers. Timber framing is like cabinet building, but bigger.There are many detailed drawings of joining techniques, and the reader quickly realizes that the craftsmanship and careful execution of these joints is the secret to this respected building trade. Flipping through these pages also immediately reveals the compromises that are made in modern home construction. Those who have ever wondered where the term "stick built" comes from will find the answer in this book. Dimensional lumber are sticks in comparison to timbers. Though metal connectors used in today's framing have done wonders for total structural stability, this book shows you that timber framing negates the need for stamped steel reinforcement.Timber framed structures are built for permanence, preserving the strength of the frame by encasing it completely within the outer sheathing and exploiting the timbers as an aesthetic interior design element. It is amazing that so many barns and houses were built only by hand, because a single timber required two or more men to lift and transport. In this age, a crane is more appropriate. One should keep this in mind if considering this project on his or her own.The captions in the book are terse and straight forward. "Wood never lies to you." "You don't just hack away obliviously." As said before, the writing is eloquent, and one can feel the earnestness of the writer with every paragraph. This excerpt sounds like it was written this year, rather than 1980:"To insulate as well as we can and to make houses as tight as we can present new challenges to the building industry. Houses will no longer naturally ventilate because of our inability to get them tight. We can lock them up like thermos bottles if we like. To bring new air into the house, we'll have to design ventilation systems into the plans. With heat loss cut to the bones, we'll have to design natural and mechanical recirculation to keep the temperature even and the air fresh. In this kind of environment, the heat from appliances, lights, and even body heat will contribute significant proportions to the small heating requirements. In houses built this way, energy from the sun, wind, or water could easily replace fuel-fired power sources.""Energy conservation is the hope of the future. In conscience, we must mark the end of the era of substandard housing that is cheap to build but expensive and wasteful to maintain. In conscience, we should begin a time when houses contain energy-autonomous environments that consume no fossil fuels and are build to last centuries."Those words are nearly three decades old. They are describing what is sometimes called a "passivhaus" or "passive house", which is also an established building technique but is only recently seeing revival as a "green" building technique. Insulation, rather than expensive heating and cooling systems, is the key to energy efficiency. What the authors are showing is that with a timber frame, the outer skin can be insulated panels that are tightly sealed, making a water tight and nearly air tight structure that is stronger, more permanent, and more energy efficient than any home constructed from dimensional lumber.And if there is any gripe of the book, it is that there should be more detail on the outer sheathing and insulating techniques, as well as wiring methods. There are a few cross sections (fairly detailed) but they are not as comprehensive as other sections of the book. Perhaps in 1980 the insulated panel industry was not large enough to devote more than a few pages to it. But now, there are composite, structurally insulated panels of many varying types that can be used in conjunction with a timber frame to build a very efficient, very strong, and architecturally pleasing home. And this is yet another example of how things come full circle; one of the oldest building techniques proves itself to be superior to its modern replacement in multiple ways.On a personal note my building experience comes from the construction of a stick built garage which, at the time, seemed incredibly stout to me. I used 2x6 lumber for the walls rather than 2x4s, and sheathed the walls and roof with 5/8" oriented strand board. I used metal connectors in liberal amounts, reinforced the joints and ceiling joists, and insulated the entire structure so that I could work during the cold months. The garage is a solid, well insulated structure that maintains a comfortable climate by insulation and thermal mass alone. I was striving for a better way of building, and after reading this book I see that my desire was for timber frame construction. I wish I would have known more about it when I undertook the garage project, but now if I ever build my own home, I know how I will build it.Lastly, the appendix has diagrams for beam loads that is nearly more comprehensive than some textbooks on the topic of strength of materials. Even if you do not intend to build a home this way, this book may still be of value to you if you have any interest in building, construction, or architecture.For more information on finishing a timber frame home with different structural insulated panel technologies, see Benson's newer book: The Timber-Frame Home: Design Construction Finishing. It has more color photos and addresses the special considerations for foundations, plumbing, wiring, and insulating timber frame homes.

review/summary: PLAY IT AGAIN, VAN
review/text: The international piano competitions have a great deal of atmosphere and `buzz' about them, not to mention a great deal of politics like any other sport. Van Cliburn was the first non-Russian to win the Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow, and when the prize in the next of those seemed inevitably to be going to Ogdon the Soviet authorities pressed a reluctant Ashkenazy into entering to split the award with him. The reclusive Cliburn founded his own event in Fort Worth, and this disc contains a selection of the entries for the first two of the series in 1962 and 1966. Recorded material appears to be thin on the ground, and the only complete work of any great length here is the Copland sonata played by gold medallist Ralph Votapek in 1962. The other contributions are from Lupu, gold medallist in 1966, and from Nicolai Petrov who was apparently silver medallist in that year, although the liner-note tells us at another point that that award went to Barry Lee Snyder.Of the three, Lupu has made the big time and deservedly so, and my impression is that the other two have not. Votapek starts very well with a movement from one of the MacDowell sonatas, displaying a big tone at the start and a lot of sensitivity and sympathy to this slightly reactionary music later. In any case it's pleasant to hear anything by MacDowell these days other than To a Wild Rose. In the three Brahms numbers from op118 there are more wrong notes than I would expect to hear from a gold medallist in any of the more recent competitions, but they are agreeably played, showing a good sense of the composer's idiom and some real originality in the clog-dance effect that he gives to the rhythm of the ballade. The Copland sonata is proficiently done, with faster speeds in the outer movements than Peter Lawson adopts, but I can't really find this performance to be any kind of rival to Lawson's in any respect at all.From Petrov we get two Scarlatti sonatas plus another movement from one by MacDowell - all goodish but hardly outstanding to my own way of thinking. Whether or not hindsight comes into the matter, I start to get a genuine sense of occasion when Lupu takes the stage with the first movement of the second Prokofiev concerto. The orchestral contribution is not helped by a very indifferent piece of recording, but I was interested to hear Lupu in this music by way of a change from the Schubert and Mozart in which I know him better. Even in Schubert I have found flashes of real and even startling power at times as well as the lyric beauty of touch for which Lupu is more renowned, and his reading here has real stature and a commanding quality to it.The recorded sound is never better than good average and not always even that. There is naturally applause from the audiences (I wouldn't have felt I was getting my money's worth without it), and they seem to contain a considerable number of sufferers from pulmonary afflictions, but I guess that's all part of the atmosphere too. Absolutely nothing on this disc could even remotely be called essential for anyone's collection. This is a temps-perdu job, for the nostalgia market, and I enjoy it simply on that basis.

review/summary: A classic
review/text: Of all the AEC recordings, I think that this recording best defines who the AEC is.It generally is more raw than their ECM recordings, and this has the best balance between improvistation and composition. You have the otherworldly Illistrum, the raw but ritualistic title track, the R&amp;B tinged Scuffle Shuffle, and a few vibrant non-Western styles in What's to Say. Nonaah is how Stockhausen would have sounded if he had hung out in the South Side of Chicago.This effort has a get-down-to-business approach which leaves virtually no dead spots on this project.This recording gets the highest of possible ratings.

review/summary: best studio recording by the Art Ensemble!
review/text: I heard FANFARE FOR THE WARRIORS for the first time when it finally appeared on CD in 1999. The original LP had been released in 1974. It is the Art Ensemble's finest studio recording! Joined by Muhal Richard Abrams on piano, it is a flawless representation of the band's facets, talents, and overall effect. FANFARE opens with Joseph Jarman reading an epic Pan-African poem by Malachi Favors over the famous Ensemble "little instruments." This captures the theatrical and mythical elements of the band at the outset. Their performances were always rituals. The rest of the album is a perfect symmetrical journey. The sadly departed Lester Bowie kicks things off with the rollicking "Barnyard Scuffel Shuffel." Roscoe leads us into the mystical with his "Nonaah," culminating with the journey's destination -- Jarman's "Fanfare." A slighter Jarman piece "What's to Say" leads back to another enigmatic Mitchell passage, "Tnoona." The journey closes as always with a blues beat -- this time it's Roscoe's "The Key."The best Art Ensemble recording is the live URBAN BUSHMEN, but FANFARE is a close second, and is a perfect introduction to the band. The overall effect was/is always greater than the sum of the parts, but each part is more perfectly realized on this album than anywhere else in their recorded output.

review/summary: Another must!
review/text: Along with Bap-tizum this lp is a must and aptly documents the excitement that was the Art Ensemble of Chicago in the early 70's. From the lyrical exploration of &quot;Illistrum&quot; to the freeform taunting of the title track to the classically influenced &quot;Tnoona&quot; each and every song takes you on a sonic spiritual journey that few jazz records ever achieve. It's interesting to note that they did not release another album for five years and when they did their music had changed somewhat which makes this record that much more important as it is the final document of their first phase and an important one it is.

review/text: These wraps were not doing anything when we placed them in "hot" water. We searched the internet and found others having the same problem. The instructions are very poor. First off, you need to dip in boiling water (or at least some temperature level above what I would call hot). Second, the instructions don't describe what should happen, should the image shrink around the egg, transfer to it -- what?Needless to say, it was frustrating for a minute or two, but my wife - who is very intelligent and great in the kitchen - immediately thought, "well... hot water wouldn't do much to change the properties of the plastic, so let's try boiling water - nothing to lose."Should be more explicit in the instructions.

Numerous Jaquith ancestors were patriots who fought and died for this country from the King Philip's War on. The only reason I did not give this family biography a 5 star rating is because some of the historical data in the living members of the Jaquith family is not correct. The older the records, the more correct the data is.

review/summary: Great Classic Sega Arcade Racing Action!
review/text: If you've played this game in the arcade and liked it, then you'll definitely like this version to play at home whenever you like. You don't need a supercomputer to run it and the graphics and controls are amazing and faithful to the incredibly fun and fast arcade experience. This version also has plenty of unlockables, which you get by playing and earning miles, as well as mini-games that are a fun diversion from the classic arcade game. It has the European-themed levels of Outrun2 and the America-themed levels of Outrun2 SP, for a total of 30 stages to race through in the classic Outrun-branching style, or sequentially, or with challenges such as beating rival racers. This game is affordable, fun, and has plenty of replay value. You may not want to play it for hours and hours, but you'll keep coming back to it if you like to get a speedy arcade fix every now and then.

review/summary: Too much sugar is bad for you
review/text: I remember playing Outrun in the arcades when it came out in the, I think it was, eighties. It had flashy graphics, flashy steering wheel, pedals, and corny, but catchy, music. It was the kind of game I'd play on the way out of the arcade when all but the last dribbles of coinage had been spent on the more 'serious' (read challenging) games. Actually, when I think about it, Outrun was always placed by the entrance, perhaps for this reason. Main meal of games inside, followed by quick dessert on the way out. And Outrun is quick. And fun. And flashy. Colourful, pretty, and simple. Not much depth here, but some very cool twists on your standard arcade racer. Lots of different Ferraris, lots of different scenery and, wow, does it look good! Pure, unadulterated eye candy. Two problems, however. It wont run on full accelerated sound on my sound card (budget Creative), so I have to switch the acceleration back to minimum through my control panel or the game will just keep crashing when it comes time to race. Secondly, the configuration for gamepad bites. It won't allow me to allocate the buttons I want for acceleration and braking, so I end up using the right analogue joystick for both (left to accelerate, right to brake). Sounds dicky, and I suppose it is, but it's actually pretty easy to get used to. As far as I'm aware there are no patches for said problems. Despite these issues Outrun 2006 C2C is a blast, fun from go to wo. It's sugary sweet and just the thing for a low gaming BSL.

review/summary: Brilliant game with short lifespan.
review/text: The original Outrun is a timeless classic. It's one of those video-games that will last forever and it came out of the golden era of wonderful arcade innovations, along with Double Dragon and Splatterhouse. Outrun was the first great racer, better than Pole Position on the Atari!!!There have been plenty of sequels and spin-offs to Outrun from the kinda okay Turbo Outrun to the just plain stupid Battle Outrun. None really had that extra spark which made the original so amazing. Outrun 2006 may not end up a classic but is still a brilliant game in it's own right.Rekindling that hedonistic, free-spirited, just-get-in-and-drive-anywhere feeling and sacrificing all the modern racing features for just sheer joyriding pleasure, Outrun 2006 is just such an easily accessible game for anyone.As usual it's filled with gorgeous scenery, brilliantly blue skies and amazing music. The classic 'Magical Sound Shower' (a great, great tune indeed) has been remixed but it also contains the 1986 mix for the purists.The only negative thing I can say about this game is that once you've finished it 5 times (such as I have already) there's not much point in going back to the same old courses. They could have included more.Ah well, it's still a game you should invest time and money in.Graphics ASound AGameplay ALasting Appeal C+

review/summary: Dont run out to get Outrun unless your from 1985
review/text: Outrun was the biggest disappointment of my holidays.If you've just come home from a life in 1985 you might enjoy this. I read the reviews before buying but it didn't sink in what Arcade style meant. I am an addicted follower of Colin MacRea rally and thought to race a ferrari across the US would be cool. I was wrong. The games is to car racing what space invaders is to "Battlefield". The landscape moves instead of the car and you have these idiotic stages like impress your girlfriend with how many slides you can do. Total rubbish. Not anyones fault but mine, but I live in Ireland and got it shipped through Florida so it is a costly mistake.

review/text: "Time Note" may be singer-songwriter Hanako Oku's most widely known CD. It contains her two big hits from the 2006 anime film "The Girl Who Leapt Through Time." Her songs are romantic, emotional piano ballads sung in Japanese. Every track is heart warming -- or heart BREAKING, sometimes it is hard to tell. I'm not sure if my heart is breaking or filled with joy. The playing and singing is so good, you do not have to understand Japanese to feel the emotional effect. Her voice is like an angel.This is a great album from a great artist.

My husband finally bought him for me and I love him! I didn't get the classic, I did get the new version. He is slightly different from the old, classic version. His name tag is a bit different as is his coloring, nose, etc. But he is unbelievably soft and cuddly. I also bought one for my great-niece and nephew. Definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Henry dog
review/text: There is something that Henry Dogs brings to a child. It's a simple toy, but such an amazing thing that happens when a child connects to it with love, companionship, and comfort. I first got my Henry Dog when I was 2 years old and it has bought much joy throughout my childhood. Now 35 years later, I still have my Henry Dog which sits in an old wicker chair in a corner of the guest room. My brother also had a Henry Dog back in the 70s, he too still has kept his Henry Dog for over 30 something years. He took his Henry Dog everywhere just as I had as a child. The Henry Dog has bought so much enjoyment as we grew up and still has a priceless value throughout our adult years. Most stuff animals children grow out of, but there is something with the Henry Dog that makes us want to hold on to it. I still love my Henry Dog, and best of all, my Henry Dog reminds me of a simple thing in life, to live life happy. Thank you for bring happiness to so many with the Henry Dog. I'm still waiting for the Henry Dog to be in stock one day so I can gift my child a Henry Dog to love and adore.

review/summary: Charisma
review/text: What it is about "Henry Dog". My daughter was 6 when we gave her Henry. Love is not the word. Obsession! A few years later my ex-wife decided he had to go. Under the guise of an "incurable" lice infection my ex-wife threw him out. Trauma followed. We bought a replacement which my daughter has safely on her closet shelf. He is thread bare. I found him online and was overwhelmed to read the reviews at Amazon.com. None had less than 5 stars. Each story told how this little guy had touched their lives. These Henry owners, both girls and boys, cherished him as if he had been a "real" dog. I guess to them, he is. Daddy had to buy his little (40 year old) daughter a new one. I got both the 14" and 3". I was on the phone when she opened the box..... Henry was home again. My granddaughter saw Henry got excited and wanted one also. She is 19 years old. This company should bottle "Henry Dog`s" charisma. Thanks for keeping him alive.

review/summary: Still got the toy since 1974
review/text: I've had this toy since I was a year old or so (honestly, I've had it for as long as I can remember). I can't believe they're still around. My 5 year old has inherited mine. She loves it very much. There isn't much too it, but for some reason she loves it just as much as I did. It's a great toy that is trans-generation. I'm sure someday my daughter will pass it on to her child, too. Henry the Dog will be around forever.

review/text: I had two Henry Dogs. One I lost in a ride at Walt Disney World, the second to replace it. I have no idea where Henry got to. But now that I found "him", I will have my friend again. I had this toy from the time I was six years old, almost 40 years ago, and I think I'll be seeing him again around Christmas time. It's a sweeet toy and really good for children of *all* ages!

review/text: Just wanted to add my voice to the chorus... :) I got this Henry for my little son 4 years ago. Of course, he's been my son's night companion ever since. We've taken him everywhere in our travels (and we do travel). Also sometimes poor Henry has to withstand some rough play during the day... I am not sure he will hold up for 40 years as the old ones did, but he's doing fine for now. This is a great toy.

review/summary: Newberger, Mazzy, and Thompson delight
review/text: If you've driven an hour to hear Ed Goldstein and Buddy Wachter, suffered through an interminable opening act to hear Jonathan Dorn and Leon Redbone, lamented that you've worn out the grooves your Howard Johnson and Taj Mahal &quot;Real Thing&quot; album, and purchased all of the recordings of Sam Pilafian and Frank Vignola, why, then, this is your genre. It's just plain fun--it makes you want to go make friends with a banjo player. The next best thing to having Eli Newberger, Butch Thompson and Jimmy Mazzy on your porch this summer would be to sit out there yourself with your boom box, your old rocking chair, a glass of iced tea, and this CD. The title of this recording is the same as that of a book by Newberger on the development of male character (Perseus, 1999). In the liner notes, Newberger cites a previous concert series &quot;Themes of Intimacy and Aggression,&quot; as using much of the same material as this recording, but one could simply characterize the men providing inspiration for these selections as &quot;bad guys and good guys,&quot; from &quot;Big Bad Bill,&quot; to being &quot;Wild About Harry.&quot; I can almost believe Jimmy Mazzy when he sings that he &quot;Ain't Misbehavin'.&quot;

review/summary: Good Overview of Subject
review/text: The book offers a good overview of the subject of woodburning. The types of tools needed are discussed; however, it was short on explanation here. The author should have spent more time examining the different types of tools and the qualities of each type. The book discusses the best types of wood for pyrographic efforts and this was useful. The book has a wide variety of designs from birds to seashore items. All are well drawn. The disigns are complex, and they are printed in the book very lightly. The problem in reproducing them comes from the lightness of the picture and the complex design. They do not reproduce as well as disigns I have found in other books.Overall I found the book informative and the designs excellent.

review/text: Although I was excited to purchase this book, my excitement didn't last when I looked at the sketches / pictures in the book. I call them pictures because that is what they truly are, not actual patterns. Norma Gregory's talent shows up well in her designs but due to their complicated rendering they are very difficult to transfer.This book is not for beginners - but more seasoned artisans.If you are looking for patterns, like I was, you will be disappointed in this book.

review/summary: A Valiant Effort, but it misses the mark.
review/text: Michele Soavi enjoys international cult-status as the maker of avant-garde horror films, and as such, his fans will not be disappointed with "Saint Francis." The first half of this movie's cup overflows with sinister characters, protracted violence, on-camera torture, and endless journeys through frightening dwellings and landscapes.That said, he made an admirable attempt to depict a "muscular" Christianity and present Francis's life without pastel colors. It had to be done and he did it. But, while this film is an artistically lush period piece and is conceptually intriguing, the realization is disappointing. The plot is somewhat muddled, the script doesn't justify its three and one-half hour length, and the characters are unremittingly stern---whereas, the hallmark of St. Francis was joy. (According to witnesses, he bore his year in prison "with cheerfulness and good temper." A better interpretation of the saint's troubadour-like personality is the father's character in the Italian film "Life is Beautiful.")Additionally, Soavi's portrayal of Francis' relationship with the Catholic Church is slightly skewed and incomplete.Saint Francis was a reformer, not a rebel.In Soavi's interpretation, Saint Francis appears as a precursor to Luther; that is, Christianity should be "sola scriptura." Add to that '"sola" nature' and '"sola"poverty' and you have the plot of this film in a nutshell. The Franciscan ideal does contain the Gospels, nature, and poverty, but it contains much more; obedience being high on the list. Saint Francis' faith was never at odds with the faith of the Catholic Church.Furthermore, belief that the Church did not allow men and women to read the Gospels in their native language is an erroneous belief, but it is widespread and one need not be anti-Catholic to hold it. This theme in the movie's plot is historically inaccurate. (What the Church guarded against were "Gospels" written in the vernacular that contained error. For those who are interested, Mario Derksen (Catholic Insight) in his essay, "Did the Catholic Church Try to Keep the Bible From the Laity?" uses modern and historical sources to argue that the Church was concerned with mis-translations, not translations.)For many good reasons Michele Soavi's film will (or, will not) resonate with viewers, but for an accurate picture of Saint Francis and Saint Clare one would do well to get a good biography. (G.K.Chesterton's "Saint Francis of Assisi," is a start.)

review/text: I looked forward to watching this movie, but was disappointed. Overall it is well made, but the representation of St. Francis was at best disappointing. I realize St. Francis's life was not a bed of roses, but there was almost no joy *AT ALL* in his life, according to this movie. Far too much crying for his character lines.Also, it was troubling to have St. Francis represented as someone almost bordering on disobedience to the Pope when he requests approval for his order. It is one thing to speak freely but they carried it too far for the saint who "rebuilt Christ's church."

review/summary: Very problematic depiction
review/text: Although visually sumptuous, gritty and sensual, this film has several problematic characteristics that prevent it from being either an enjoyable or edifying portrayal of St. Francis.In the first place, a_very_blatant Protestant plot element is inserted in the movie, with an apparent Waldensian St. Francis meets in prison. The man is there because he translated the Gospels into "the common tongue" and is then brutally tortured for such "heresy", but not before he passes his ragged Bible to Francis, whose faith is awakened by this first introduction to the Word of God.The second problem is that the movie does not attempt to attribute any sort of supernatural explanation to Francis' actions, but instead gives a naturalistic depiction of his life. God does not speak to Francis here. The closest we come to anything miraculous was when Francis and his brothers saw a large flock of birds. Even his stigmata is played down to resemble nothing more than scrapes on his hands. It is also hinted at that it is self-inflicted, since the movie earlier showed us Francis intentionally grasping a thorny stick as hard as he could, and wounding his hands.The third issue is that Francis' personality is just warped in this movie. He is portrayed as a delusional, self-harming, neurotic lunatic, an amiable simpleton at best. He is frequently shown crying, moaning, rolling around the ground in pain, spitting up blood. It is none-too-subtly hinted at that he was nuts.The fourth problem is that the movie is interminable. It is almost 3 hours long. If it contained any sort of plot development or dramatic tension, that would have been bearable, but with Francis mostly just acting strangely, it was not a pleasant experience.The movie isn't all bad, as I said. It is beautiful to watch, and so far as I can translate Italian, the acting seemed powerful to me. I was glad it didn't obscure Francis' faith, as Zefferelli's proto-hippy Francis seemed to do. However, the problems I elucidated above ruined it all for me.

review/summary: Interesting
review/text: An interesting early book by the great historian of ideas JGA Pocock. This book focuses on what Pocock calls the history of historiography in 17th century England. Pocock is concerned mainly with reconstructing how 17th century intellectuals thought about their past. This apparently recondite topic turns to have a number of interesting dimensions. Pocock begins with a surprising and interesting fact, that something prefiguring historical analysis emerged from the study of legal traditions. This occurred first in 16th century France, where the emerging methods of humanist textual criticism were applied to legal traditions. The existence of different legal traditions in France led several scholars to discover the dynamic quality of legal history, the discovery of feudalism, and reconstruction of legal history in the context of a form of social history. In England, where the common law tradition had no competitors, the evolution of knowledge followed a different course. The common lawyers, epitomized by the great Edward Coke, projected the common law and contemporary English political institutions back into an immemorial past as a permanent feature of English life. This treatment of English legal history was entangled in efforts to resist James I assertions of royal power.Subsequent scholars, notably the great antiquarian Henry Spelman, partly inspired by French scholars, subsequently discovered the changing nature of English law, discovered feudal law, and made inferences from legal history to imaginative and insightful reconstructions of medieval English society. Pocock evinces particular symppathy for Spelman's efforts to elucidate non-anachronistic understandings of key terms and concepts, an activity very similar to Pocock's own scholarly goals. Pocock traces the influence of Spelman's discoveries on subsequent scholars and how these reconstructions of English history were entangled in 17th century politics. This book concludes with a nice chaper on the treatment of English history following the Glorious Revolution, describing the emergence of the Whig version of English history and looking forward to the work of important 18th century historians like Robertson and Hume.Like of all of Pocock's work, this book is characterized by close analysis of the texts, Pocock's impressive erudition, and clear writing.

review/summary: Tales of the world I never knew and never will
review/text: Thanks to my grandparents, who came to America in the first decade of the 20th century, I grew up and have had a good life. Thanks to my grandparents, I didn't become a piece of ash or a few tossed out bones in an Eastern European field at the age of 2. Wars are wars; they've occured throughout human history, but in most of them, whole civilizations didn't disappear. But the Eastern European Jewish world is gone forever. I might belong to the same gene pool, but compared to the characters in Isaac Bashevis Singer's stories, I'm as American as apple pie. Irish-Americans can discover their roots in Ireland, Chinese-Americans in China, and so on, but not me. My cultural roots are gone forever. The only way I can learn them is through reading literature written by Singer, Shalom Aleichem, Isaac Babel and others who describe that vanished world. So, obviously, my interest and pleasure in reading such wonderful tales as appear in THE SEANCE and OTHER STORIES is all the more. Never mind my personal reasons. These amazing stories, by a Nobel Prize winner, will stay with you for a long time. The strange, sad characters afflicted by poverty and by life, bring us face to face with common human personalities of all times and places, while also depicting the conditions and peculiar relationships of Jews in Poland too. Magic, religion, animals, thieves, rabbis, prostitutes, mystics, Holocaust survivors, Talmudic scholars, prisoners, books, butchers and shopkeepers crowd the pages. In each story, you find pathos and tragedy, happiness and satisfaction, tensions and transformations. Two of the stories, "The Seance" and "The Letter Writer" must rank with the best stories I have ever read; none of the others are bad. If you have never read Singer, this is an excellent book to start with. If you have, you know what I am talking about. This is the great writer at the top of his form.

review/text: Isaac Bashevis Singer was no doubt one of the greatest short story writers - ever! The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker, Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories, which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories, where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool, Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad, funny, ironic, poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts. This is what good short stories is all about!

review/text: THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES is a collection by Isaac Bashevis Singer first published in 1968. Singer wrote primarily in Yiddish, and the 16 short stories here have been translated into English by various translators, though overseen by the author.Singer's stories are invariably set among Jewish communities, the majority in the Polish Jewish villages of the late Russian Empire, though three are set in the postwar United States. Readers of this collection should have a basic knowledge of Jewish customs, for example, what a mezzuzah is. Still, behind the trappings of culture, the characters are universal and anyone will recognize themselves and their acquaintances here. At times, however, Singer is more interested in allegory than realism, and the characters represent the Jewish people. Singer's depiction of Polish Jewish life is not a nostalgic reminisce of some purer age, and the frankness of Singer's themes is remarkable. The subject of "Yanda" is a provincial prostitute, while "Zeitl and Rickel" describes the doomed lesbian romance of two pious girls.Found by chance in a "take a book, leave a book" pile, THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES was my introduction to this Nobel laureate. While I'm not so bowled over by the stories to want to seek out other works by this author, the material is consistently entertaining (the 200 pages are a quick read) and some of the endings memorable.

review/text: This is the second time I have bought this jacket. I wore the first one out! I am an attorney and it is becoming difficult to find tailored clothes to fit a mature woman. I plan to buy this jacket in some other colors now that I have the proper size. This is a great easy wearing piece for any professional woman young or old.

review/summary: Unbelievable music!
review/text: I heard "Troya" on Sirius/XM's Chill station, and set about finding the music. "Dreaming Of" appears not to be available in MP3 (or I just missed it). If you have to buy it on CD, wait for a reasonable price here, or find it somewhere else online. Having heard the entire disc, I would have paid a lot more than I did. Still, the reseller prices I see as of this writing are a bit steep. I paid $18.50 including shipping -- a normal price for a title outside the mainstream. Worth every penny.

review/summary: Not sure about the title
review/text: This not a &quot;how to&quot; guide to &quot;swinging&quot; (or whatever people call it) but in fact much more a book that addresses the question of being together and growing with a partner while retaining individuality and seperatedness within a relationship of honesty, trust and openess. I felt a lot less cynical and much more positive about the institution of marriage as a result of reading this book.I thought it was excellent and I feel it's a book that would probably appeal to many more people if the title was different. But then again it was because of the title that I found it. Highly recommended for any relationship whether or not marriage is a part of it.

review/summary: A great informative must read. Not just for open marriage.
review/text: I feel that this book can apply to every romantic pairing. This is not just a book for those contemplating an open marriage. This is a book that can give you great ideas regarding space in a relationship. It expands on the idea that just because you are part of a couple does not mean you have to give up yourself. It promotes the idea of still mainting and developing new ideas and hobbies about yourself. It really has so very little to do with sex and more to do with keeping your own life exciting and not expecting the marriage to solve all your fulfilment needs.

review/summary: An Excellent Book about Open Marriage - NOT Swinging!
review/text: The title of this book has become misleading only because the meaning of the words "Open Marriage" has changed over the decades.This book is an excellent guide for people interested in all the aspects of attaining and living in an open marriage, which is an overall way of life, not just sexual freedom. Everything from sex to doing the dishes is covered in this book. Some of the language may sound dated since it's original printing, but then again, so does Shakespeare.This the best book I have ever found to learn about ALL aspects of your marital relationships (not just the sexual ones) and discover the ways in which people try to control and eventually destroy each other as individuals within a marriage.If you want a book on "swinging" (a/k/a recreational, non-monogomous sex) then this is NOT the book you are looking for. But then again, Open Marriage is leaps and bounds beyond just swinging. This book guides you through making this a way of life in a wonderful way, changing the traditional marriage views in ALL aspects, including non-monogomous sex, but not JUST sex.How do I know this? I've been living this way for 15 years and still going happy and strong. My first "traditional" marriage lasted 3 years.

review/summary: title refers to open communication and self examination, not swinging
review/text: Please don't be confused by the unfortunate choice of title, nor by the ridiculous books promoting promiscuity that are associated with it by Amazon databases.Let's examine the two negative reviews of this book.One reviewer admits that he had decided the book wasn't worthwhile before reading it, and proceeds with an attitude that dares the authors to change his mind. This is hardly an "open" reading, is it? Further, the message of this book is in no way negated by a supposed divorce between the authors. The authors of Open Marriage specifically instruct readers to examine their expectation that marriage lasts forever.Another reviewer has a vested interest in dismissing Open Marriage, because its ideas contradict those of a book he wrote. He is careful to advertise his own book in his negative review of Open Marriage.As for whether Open Marriage is outdated, since when did such things as communication and trust become outdated? With extremes of ideology and dogma on a rapid increase, a book that promotes careful examination of our assumptions and expectations before getting married has never been more relevant. Has Socrates' dictum "An unexamined life is not worth living" ever gone out of date?Briefly, I'll quote from chapter 4:"The guidelines [to healthy relationships] are as follows:1 realistic expectations2 privacy3 open and honest communication4 flexibility in roles5 open companionship6 equality7 identity8 trustWhere do love, sex, and fidelity fit in? Are these not guidelines too - the basic components of any marriage? Important, yes; guidelines, no. Many of the problems with the closed marriage [defined by poor communication, lack of trust, immaturity etc.] stem from a false concept of the part that love, sex, and fidelity play in the relationship between man and a woman. The guidelines of open marriage listed above form the basis upon which love, sex, and fidelity achieve their meaning, not vice versa. If personal identity is based on love, equality measured by sex, and trust defined by fidelity, then identity will be crushed by a lessening of the initial romantic fervor, equality diminished by a temporary failure in sex, and trust destroyed through even the appearance of infidelity. But if personal identity, equality and trust exist in full measure, then the normal fluctuations that occur in any relationship between two human beings can be taken in stride."One way of looking at the book Open Marriage is to say that the authors are discussing which comes first, the chicken or the egg? They are revealing that love, sex, and fidelity are outcomes of mature relating, thus not the cause of mature relating. If we reverse causation and pursue the product directly, without the process, than we set in motion a degradation from expectation, to demands, to manipulation, to frustration, and ending in "bitter disappointment" (chapter 4). For example, suspicious jealousy pursues fidelity directly, bypassing the process of building trust and commitment. On the other hand, when we follow the above 8 principles of healthy relating, the likely outcome is love, and fidelity. I recall a TV Sitcom in which a holiday family reunion wasn't going well, and someone angrily threatened that "we all had better start having fun right now!" Again, pursuit of the outcome directly without the process, results in our realizing the very thing we most fear (can you hear echoes of Dr. Phil McGraw in this?)The authors are saying that an unexamined marriage will fail because our unconscious assumptions, demands, and expectations are going to take over, and a great deal of negative conflict will result. These authors are simply saying that we need to pay attention and be proactive, examine our thoughts and feelings openly, and negotiate a mutually acceptable relationship. This open communication and cooperation, as opposed to conflict, is what the authors refer to in the title of their book. They are referring to a Socratic openness to challenging one`s own thoughts and behaviors as a basis of healthy living. This point is strongly supported by Dr. M. Scott Peck, author of The Road Less Traveled, who refers to Open Marriage on page 93 of ...Traveled. Dr. Peck's says the same thing with a different metaphor: we ought to examine our mental "maps" and be willing to revise them to keep ourselves dedicated to reality. Let Dr. Peck's reference carry more weight than mine.

review/summary: Outdated & overripe
review/text: This book reached its "sell before" date about 25 years ago. Better books have been written, but haven't been hyped so thoroughly, so it keeps getting reprinted.The "open marriage" concept has -- REPEAT AFTER ME -- absolutely nothing to do with sexual nonmonogamy. Rather, the authors examine the problem of what another author has called "the couple front," where couples feel they must act as if they're surgically joined, & end up feeling confined & eventually hating each other.If you are NOT interested in nonmonogamy, then read ANY book by Harville Hendrix & you'll find thoughts that are much more practical.If you ARE interested in nonmonogamy (group marriage, polyamory, etc.), then start with Intimate Friendships (Ramey), Polyamory (Ravenscroft -- whoops, that's me), Polyamory (Anapol), Honest Sex (Roy & Roy), or Group Marriage (Constantine & Constantine)... or even The New Faithful (Nearing), or Three in Love (Foster).I usually see ten copies of this book at any thrift store. That's somehow fitting.

review/text: This book is a classic when it pertains to building and establishing a relationship that works for you and your partner. It is written with a much different perspective and definition of an open marriage than today's view of Open Marriage.I highly urge anyone in a relationship to read this book together with their partner as a way to stimulate and nurture individual and collective growth.Please keep in mind the time period this book was written in, as some of the examples used to illustrate points will not speak to the current dynamics between the sexes.Overall, it's a thoughtful and transforming read.

review/summary: Actually, some decent advice.
review/text: The criticisms of this book are mostly about its non-monogamous aspect: the O'Neills (allegedly) broke up, therefore their relationship style is null and void. By this logic, is monogamy null and void, because monogamous people divorce? No type of relationship--straight, gay, monogamous, polyamorous, etc--is guaranteed against breakup. There are also horrendous relationships that are together forever because of desperation or beliefs. Even if there is a higher percentage of breakup in a certain relationship style, is "together until death" the only measure of a valid relationship?As many people pointed out, "open marriage" back then didn't mean specifically what it does now. In this book it means communicating openly, treating each other as equals, and allowing each other personal freedom. Most of this book is about how to get along better in a relationship by remembering that you both are individuals. You don't have to do everything together or have everything in common. You don't have to give up separate interests that your partner doesn't share. You don't have to give up friends when you get married. Giving up things like that don't make couples closer; they make couples resent each other and also take away their outside support systems.They mention non-monogamy as a possibility if both partners agree to it. They mention that depending on the context, sex with another person may not be the most horrible betrayal in a marriage (I said, depending on context. There are plenty of times it is a major betrayal.) Specifically I remember the passage about "the grass is always greener", and how with no fence, there is less of that feeling.My criticism of the "love and sex without jealousy" chapter is they talk about not having jealousy, but aren't very specific about how to deal with it and how to overcome it. (There are other books on open relationships that go into more detail about that.)Another criticism is that at times it relies on a premise of both people having careers that allow for economic independence. A career like that is not available to all people; there is no reason that only people with good careers should be able to have good relationships.There are lots of self-help books that promise a "one and only way" to have a satisfying relationship if you follow some off-the-wall advice, including the "emotional infidelity" variety that do advise couples to avoid friends and spend all of their time together. This book, in comparison, is common sense. Whether you want to be monogamous or non-monogamous, I think this book provides practical advice that should be elementary, but often isn't.

review/text: The O'Neills' exciting, original approach to married life shows you and your mate how the stifling, limited arrangement you've always thought marriage had to be can be opened up into an honest, undemanding, joyful relationship. they'll introduce you to the OPEN MARRIAGE concepts-trust, liking, role flexibility, individual freedom and growth, and love and sex without jealousy-that can do wonders for your marriage. OPEN MARRIAGE must be read before you get married-or before your marriage gets a day older!~*~This book needs to modernized. I see there is a 1984 version, but I don't know how that fits in today's age. It is a dry read, but I pushed thru and did get a few ideas to allow my own marriage to grow and flourish.

review/summary: As Bad a Production as Possible
review/text: This Broadway Theatre Archive production took one of the wittiest, most sparkling 18th-century comedies--and ruined it. The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse. The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like "The School for Scandal" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what? Anyone who actually likes this play will be revolted by this DVD.

review/summary: Hands down the best SCHOOL... I've found
review/text: If all you care about is slick packaging and color video, by all means pass on to the thoroughly acceptable color DVD from the Broadway Theatre Archive, but if you want to see Richard Brinsley Sheridan's classic Restoration Comedy, THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL, performed by a theatre cast which would be hard to beat, this wonderful production starring a very young Joan Plowright and the always wonderful Felix Aylmer (don't miss him in the theatrical films of Bernard Shaw's THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA and SAINT JOAN) should be on your shelves. The smash hit 1963 Broadway production (recorded on Command Records) with John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson *may* have surpassed this production for polish, but I have yet to see a film or video production which could.Sheridan's play premiered in London during the spring of 1777, and was playing in New York before the final shots were fired in our War For Independence. I'm having trouble finding the exact date of the broadcast documented in this Video Yesteryear release (and how I wish the packaging on more video releases from even more "upscale" releasers included such important information), but this video gives you the feel of what our founding fathers (and the British officers occupying New York for most of that war) must have enjoyed when it was new - the very graininess of the released film contributes to the illusion - and reminds us as effectively as the wonderful 1776 musical that they were actually flesh and blood people too. What a pleasure to share a high pleasure like this with them.

review/summary: A step in the right direction!
review/text: This is ground breaking work. It moves away from the abstract, dualistic ideas of God that are grounded in Greek philosophical and pagan concepts. T. F. Torrance describes in detail where these ideas originated from and how they often threatened the integrity of the gospel. The churches in the first few hundred years were forever challenged with concepts and ideas that had no grounding in Scripture and tradition. By contrasting Jesus Christ as the centre for all our understanding about who God is and what God does against false concepts, Torrance very effectively shows how the church today has lost this vital focus. I would consider this book to be a masterpiece in bringing the cosmic reality of the gospel in the person and work Jesus Christ to a shocking and utterly staggering degree. If you dare to read this book, be prepared to be radically changed forever!

Nowadays, though, Mini DV seems to be taking over with even smaller cassettes and better picture quality. However, I don't have that kind of money to afford a DV or Digital 8mm camcorder. Yet.Enter the TRV-108, a nifty little video camera that uses the HiBand 8mm format, superior to 8mm, but certainly not in the ballpark of Digital8 or DV. Still, its compact size and light weight make it easy to carry around almost anywhere and given the first 8mm camcorder I ever used was big enough that part of it sat on my shoulder, this is a great improvement. It comes with a 160 minute `InfoLithium' battery and little else except a lens cap and strap. It takes great pictures and has a nifty menu system navigated by a little wheel at the back that works like like a volume control and when you have selected what you want from the on-screen display, you just press the wheel to make it happen. This makes titling a snap. I do miss the title image-grabbing function from older 8mm cameras, though.The 2.5" color back lit LCD screen is clear and easy to read in all but the brightest sunlight and failing that, it also has a small .5" black and white display through the view finder. The 40x zoom is fantastic, but you better have steady hands in order to use it. And using the 460x digital zoom is impossible with anything but a tripod. The camera is equipped with a nightshot mode that actually does work, amplifying light in dark areas, making the image more visible, if green. The TRV-108 also comes with some neat digital effects like sepia tone, which gives video a nice old movie look, a pastel effect which gives everything a cartoony look, black and white, 16:9 aspect shots, plus other effects. It can also do snazzy digital fade-ins and fade-outs.This camera only really has two failings. For the most part, built in camera lights are useless, but the TRV-108 doesn't even have an accessory shoe for mounting an external light source. Something I found kind of maddening to the point where I even toyed with the idea of finding a camera at a garage sale, ripping it apart, and super glue the shoe to the top. Second, while the built-in microphone is very sensitive at picking up voices and ambient sounds, it does not have a foam wind sock. In moderate winds the roar of the air as it passed over the mike caused a lot of noise. And if it's too loud, like when I shot at the base of a waterfall, the noise caused image distortion lines! These two missing features cost the camera a full five-star review.All in all though, this is a pretty decent little toy. It's not a serious camcorder and a far from a Canon GL-1s or Xl-1s, but for what I use it for, it's still pretty darn good. It's also low cost enough that purchasing it and using it as a good way to find out if you want to go for a bigger and better camera with more features, whether it be a Digital8 or Mini DV camera. It has taught me a lot about framing shots and what a pain the noon day sun can be. The long life of the battery means that, with a little mental effort, you can shoot a full 2 hour tape on one battery. Not bad for a trip to the zoo to send a tape to your folks.

review/summary: Poor battery life mars a decent camcorder
review/text: Hi8 is fast fading into oblivion as MiniDV takes over the world and gets cheaper. If you want good video quality, you should go with a namebrand MiniDV camcorder -- I recommend Sony, Panasonic and Canon. On the other hand, if you don't shoot a lot of videos and want something cheap, the Hi8 is still a good way to go. (I bought the TRV108 as a gift but tested it before giving it to my uncle-in-law.)To someone who's used to MiniDV camcorders, the TRV108 feels big. It's actually normal for a 8mm camcorder. The LCD screen is sharp and bright -- but as we shall see later, also a battery hog. The traditional eye-piece viewfinder is b&w;, which is bad if you want to use it to conserve battery power.The TRV108 gives out good video quality on Hi8 tapes. I would rate it "high" for a Hi8 model, but even the cheapest MiniDV camcorders (except for Samsung) can match such quality -- plus they offer more bells and whistles. One nice thing is the inclusion of Sony's NightShot infrared technology -- now you can turn your lights off and make those ghostly videos like in Blair Witch Project and Silence of the Lambs. :) The TRV108 also includes a host of effects you can add to your video footage.One bad thing, though, is this model does not have the stabilizer. The TRV308 and other more expensive models include Sony's digital stabilizer. On the other hand, digital stabilizers degrade quality, so they work better on a digital camcorder than an analog one like the TRV108. Just make sure you have sturdy hands and arms.Now the battery. The battery is definitely a problem and you'll want to buy an extra capacity battery. While the LCD turned on, you'll run out of the included battery in a matter of minutes. You can save power by using the b&w; viewfinder, but that defeats the purpose of having the LCD, doesn't it? One plus feature is the included AC adapter works at both 110V and 220V.If you have [the money], I highly recommend a MiniDV camcorder. Otherwise, make the TRV108 your entry-level home video making machine. You just can't beat its price and good quality for a Hi8 model.

review/summary: Best Deal in Sony Hi8 Camcorder Ever!
review/text: I've been waiting and waiting for the best value in a Sony Hi8 Camcorder and by far this is it! This is my very first camcorder. I've been doing a lot of research and comparison on which sony model will suit me best, then this came out. I quickly grabbed it after finding out how reasonably priced it was. I bought it at [a local store] during [a] Sale... I've never laid hand on a camcorder before and I am very pleased to find out how easy it was to operate. I was able to do the playback on my TV and dubbing on my VCR with ease. It has great features, great sound and best of all best picture quality. I know there are a lot of people out there like myself who are not ready to spend a lot of money on a camcorder especially for the very first time. Well, you will not be disappointed with this one! It comes with all the accessories to get you started. Battery charging is very fast, instructions are easy to follow when it comes to recording, playback and editing, the night shot feature is great, best of all the LCD screen is so fun to use especially when you have a "little one" to capture on video. This is definitely as great buy!

review/summary: Affordable Camcorder for Novice Users!
review/text: This was our family's first camcorder and I'd have to say that it does its job wonderfully. This camcorder has all the basic features you need to create great home videos. Our results so far are very satisfying. The only drawback is that you must buy an extra battery AND a camcorder bag! These are essential accessories that you must get if you plan to travel with your camcorder. What I love about this camcorder is that it could automatically convert to 220V, which is great when you travel. There's also the nightshot feature. I guess what this lacks is the 'image stabilizer.' However, I heard that stabilizers may actually worsen the picture quality on Hi8 camcorders. Whatever the case, we are very happy with our purchase and would highly recommend this product. It's high quality by a great brand and it would last you til you upgrade ...

review/summary: Great camera for the price
review/text: Wanted a camera for Christmas and got this one because of the price, and needless to say it's a great camera. Just got back from DisneyWorld and the 108 performed extremely well. The nightshot proved handy in those dark rides, and the quality of picture was well for the Festival of the Lion King performance. The only problem I saw was that the autofocus was slow to adapt at times during those fireworks and laser shows. I didn't expect it to keep up, but it did better than I expected. Talk about impact resistant, I had a hissy when it fell out of the bag into the boat on the pirates of the carribean, but it took a lickin and it's still ticking. Once home, I just connected it to my TV and watched my vacation replay. Great camera for the price, definately worth more. Only thing better is digital. Sony has a winner here.

review/summary: Replaced Old Sony TR 100 Hi 8 With this
review/text: My old hi 8 went caput after 10 years use that was very trouble free.The new one has way more features that the 100 and costs much less. ...I use the viewfinder instead of the display as I am used to it and so far have recorded 3 hours on it and it tells me I have 2 hours left. I used the telephoto constantly which takes power put am very happy with the resultsI recharge the battery after use with the no memory effect so no problems. I use the supplied battery for dubbing and it will run 2 hrs in the dubbing mode which is great.I dub hi 8 super vhs output to a super vhs vcr and do not notice andy difference in the quality of the dub.Yes there is a more blurry picture if you dub to standard vhs but that is normal.Unless you want to do some super pro stuff this camera is the one to get. Dave PS get metal evaporated tape for top notch 400 lines picture quality.

review/summary: Great for a first camera
review/text: The camera is very easy to use. It's not as bulky as other reviews make it out to be. The battery life has been great and the picture clarity has been great also. I have been using it to tape track meets and everything can be seen clearly. Remember that you will have to buy tapes for this camera, but that is no problem for the clarity you will get. I have not tried out all the other features like night vision, but from what I have seen so far, this camera is a real good bargain. I know 5 other people who have the same item and they do not have any complaints.The flip out lcd screen is clear also. It's like using a digital camera...but only with the tapes. Only downside I have seen is that it is a little hard to keep steady based on the videos watched. The camera seems to move around alot, but again, the picture clarity is great regardless of the low price. If you don't want to upgrade to ditigal, start with this camcorder. You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Serendipity!
review/text: I was very pleased with the video camera. However, it had a problem which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Like my original camera, it wouldn't move the tape in any direction. More than that, the tape would not go all the way down and came back out. Then I noticed that a rubber roller (turned out to be the capstan roller) was loose at the bottom of the tape area blocking the tape from going all the way down. I shook it out, but the tape wouldn't move ... just like the problem with my original video camera. Upon looking closer at my original camera, I noticed the capstan roller was loose in it also but not in a position that didn't prevent the tape from loading. After finding the manual on-line, I saw where the capstan went.I know I wouldn't have been able to fix my original camera if I hadn't purchased my new cameral through Amazon. Since I just paid half of what the original camera cost me (which was already heavily discounted), I am very happy with the result. Further searching on-line revealed to me that this is a common problem with this camera. The solution was also revealed ... always have a tape in the camera, and the capstan will not get loose. I suspect that when the camera was mailed to me that it was working fine, but the rigors of the shipment probably knocked the capstan loose since it came with no tape insideSony CCDTRV118 Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5" LCD. I am very happy at this unusual experience, and continue to be delighted that I have had great results everytime I purchase anything from Amazon. The reason I purchased the 2nd camera is that I have a lot of tapes of my grandson (now 21) playing Little League baseball that I want to copy onto DVDs and now will take more videos of my younger grandson playing ball. One thing I've always loved about this camera is that it is easy to use, and it has a zoom to "kill for." Sometimes I use it as an electronic telescope because it is so powerful.

review/summary: GREAT CAMERA - HOMERUN!!!!!
review/text: I exclusively buy Sony Electronics because in my opinion they are the best. When I bought this Camera I knew that the quality would be there because it is a Sony. The camera works well except it is a little bulky. I primarily use this camera to film my son playing in the little league and it works well at capturing high speed action. It also is somewhat impact resistant because at his last little league game the umpire claimed my son was out when he was safe. Everyone knew that except for the umpire himself. I hit that fat porker right in the face with the camera (while it was on) and it captured everything - the picture quality was amazing and the sound was crystal clear. That fat slob hit the floor like a ton of bricks and was out cold. A couple of weeks later I got a letter from his lawyer and I had to appear in court because he filed a lawsuit against me. I showed the judge the tape of my son being safe and even he commented on the quality of the sound and picture and said my son was not out either. The judge dropped the charges all because of this great little camera.

review/summary: No instructions included...
review/text: The price was right for this cable ($11.95+$4.94 S&H;) compared with Sony Ericssons offering ($25+). There are a few different prices on Amazon through the same company, MyNetDeals.com, so make sure you get the $11.95 one.So I popped the CD in, followed the 2 line .txt instruction file on the disk and...nothing happened?!? Well, my phone started to charge. If you have a similar problem you may try what I did.I had previously installed a variety of the S.E. downloadable software on my computer. It took me about 15 minutes of fumbling around, but I made my way to the Phone Monitor Options by opening the catcheventatl.exe in C:\Program Files\Sony Ericsson\Mobile\Mobile Phone Monitor. From the pop-up window you have to hit the Options button. There may be a better way to get here, but this is how I did it. Go to the COM Ports tab and enable all of the COM ports. It told me it wouldnt enable COM4 because of an IR conflict, but within a few seconds, my phone was recognized, presumably on one of the remaining ports. I may not have had this issue if I installed the software fresh with the cable, but I had previously been using the IR feature to transfer data. The cable is faster than IR, but not tremendously. The big benefit is you dont have to worry about losing line of site and messing up your download.Hope you have success.

review/summary: Beware 3rd Party Cables & Sony Ericsson Tech Support
review/text: Well, it technically does what it is supposed to do--that is, allows you to transfer files from your phone to your computer or vice versa. But, it is rude & puts up a fight to do so. The thing came with no instructions, so it took forever to install. Once installed, it creates a desktop icon which can't be removed or modified...because it's not actually a desktop icon (when I figure out what exactly this thing is, I'll post it) or in the registry at all. Actual transfer of files takes over the entire computer (don't have anything else running) and is slower than a floppy drive! I've found a ton of settings and such that the software changed without asking (rude in my book), so I'm probably going to have to re-install Windows to get everything back the way I like it. Although, it's nice to have the pics off my phone to email and have a custom wallpaper & ringtones on my phone, I'm really thinking of returning this rude little punk. If I could, I'd give it zero stars.(I'm not 100% sure that this will make a difference since the main problem appears to be Sony's software that you download from them, but the cable appears to be made by someone other than Sony and the oficial Sony Data cable is pretty much only sold through Sony's website.)Update on 6/4/2006:I was given a data cable for my Sony Ericsson z500a as a gift (turned out to be a 3rd party cable like this product is). At first, I was happy that I'd be able to transfer pictures taken with my camera phone to my computer to email to friends back home...but after installing everything, the thing only worked a few times at a nerve-rackingly slow pace. After tons of headaches messing with that, I contacted Sony's tech support. They don't seem to know how to figure out problems very well, and about all they could do on that call was get my info to send out a new cable. The new cable (Sony Ericsson cable) doesn't seem to work either, and I've called them several times now--each time speaking with 2-3 reps.So, my advice would be to not bother with the data cable (third party or Sony's) since neither will work properly. If you have a third party cable such as this product, don't tell Sony tech support because then they won't help you, so you're basically just out the money you spent on a cheap unofficial cable. Just enjoy your Sony Ericsson z500a & watch anyone who has a camera phone that has a working data cable for ideas for your next phone.

review/summary: Don't Take the Chance - Get the SE Branded Cable
review/text: If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.

review/summary: Masterful interpretations
review/text: Of many CDs I've purchased in the last couple of years, this easily ranks as one of the best. Kudos to Muse for finally recording Spaulding as a leader in 1988 and now to Joel Dorn for reissuing the disk.As the title indicates, &quot;Brilliant Corners&quot; is filled with music by Monk. But what stands out is the freshness of the interpretations of the master's pieces. Rather than simply trying to sound like Monk, Spaulding and his cohorts try -- very successfully -- to make music that builds on Monk's ideas.Spaulding tears through every solo he has on alto, and offers beautiful contrast with his flute playing, as on &quot;Let's Cool One.&quot; He's aided by trumpeter Wallace Roney, who abandons his occasional propensity for imitating Miles Davis and instead lets his own sound shine through. Pianist Mulgrew Miller has never sounded better. In fact, the whole group (Ron Carter on bass and Kenny Washington on drums) strongly delivers the message that they are playing music that they love. There is no better way to express that love than by offering the robust voicings that you hear on this disk.If there is a regret when you listen to this music it is that Spaulding, who contributed so much to Blue Note dates in the '60s, has had so few opportunities to further explore his own muse. Better late than never.

review/summary: A fine effort by a mainly forgotten star
review/text: Story goes that after a number of excellent second horn sessions on mid 60's Blue Note where flute.alto,and soprano were wielded masterfully by James Spaulding he was given a shot as a leader.He was the non star(leader) that was called in many,many times.But at the point he got his offer Direction/Production had switched from Alfred Lion to Francis Wolff and A&R; fro Ike Quebec to Duke Pearson.Bottom line was they offered Spaulding a shot if he would fit into the new funky blues idiom of the Liberty era and he refused not being true to the hard bop form.Well even though he recorded few albums as a leader latter on labels like Muse("Smile Of The Snake" and "Blues Nexus are also fine 4 star or better efforts).He he has and excellent session with Wallace Ronney on trumpet,Mulgrew Miller and Ron Carter on bass, and Kenny Washington on drums.Fine line up.And though there are so many Monk tribute Lp's it is the musicianship wielded with passion that makes this a cut of above.As mentioned his flute playing is fine.I find jazz flute hit or miss and here it just works fine.Not a direct copy of the Monk style it shows th timeless of the compositions (not that a total analogue LP with some personal character is bad-see Walter Davis Jr. piano solo "In Walked Thelonius").I'd call this no an essential Lp but for Monk fans it may be.CheersChazz

review/summary: Espionage and paranoia
review/text: If you enjoy spy novels primarily for their depiction of paranoia, this album is well worth getting. The lyrics were written by Jeanette Obstoj, and for me they play a huge part in making this album tense, sometimes unsettling, and interesting. Basically, I think the lyrics are great, and Rupert Hine does a great job of delivering them in a very precise, chilly, and thankfully unaffected voice.It might be a concept album. Certainly thematically there is a great deal of continuity from song to song. To emphasize that, Rupert Hine mixed it so many of the songs fade up from out of the preceding one, which makes the album seem more cohesive.Musically, it has a bit of a prog-rock, new wave/synthesizer feeling. A few things save it from the perils of either genre (bombast and brittle anemic prodcution, that is). First, the production is fantastic. Crystalline, really. What synthesizers there are sound quite varied and interesting, and not thin imitations of string lines like so many early 80s synth bands used. Think more Japan or Thomas Dolby than say Duran Duran or other less interesting bands. Also, there's a lot of acoustic percussion on this, like marimba and wood blocks. Second, the music and songs are very economic and tense, with very little messing around on solos. As good as the music is, it's very much a vehicle for the lyrical subject matter, which is tense, nervous, and very much in the crosshair's site. Third, Rupert Hine is a great soundpainter, using thunder, rain, and ticking clocks to heighten the mood, making the overall impression very much like a spy movie or film noir.This album might be almost 30 years old, but the quality of the production, arrangements, subject matter (paranoia and espionage will never go out of style), and playing render it incapable of aging in a negative way. Fantastic job, Rupert!

review/text: This was the 2nd recording in Hine's early 80's A&amp;M Trilogy. As fine as it is, his first, Immunity, is the better work. This one lacks some of the intensity, and downright scariness that marked some of the previous work. Still, there are some standout tracks such as &quot;The Set-Up&quot; with clever lyrics and a great melody. &quot;Eleven Faces&quot; explodes with a vast sound. &quot;Dark Windows&quot; is set to the sound of a Thunderstorm, and is suitably brooding and haunting. Get this one after Immunity, but well worth having if you like Immunuty.

review/summary: Never gets going
review/text: This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written.

review/summary: Fissure a mile-wide in this thin, confusing novel.
review/text: Early on in this story reader is informed that main character has a split personality. 3 girls are murdered and buried in back yard of Mary Barton, protagonist. Mary B. is sweet and loves her garden. Her other half is wicked to the max. The novel starts with her cussing like a sailor, wholly unlike sweet Mary B. The incredibly stupid atty. doesn't infer anything about the seeming two Mary's. Mary B. charged with murder that she obviously committed. Most of book contains court scenes that are well-written but are merely banal and static, the story stops. After conviction inevitable knife attack on atty by bad Mary, who we now learn is a twin of good Mary; at least that's the way the book reads. Within the reality of the book this is impossible and nonsense. But the reader is supposed to believe that good Mary has an evil twin who did the killings...I read the ending of the novel several times to see if it was communicating to the reader that the bad Mary was just the evil side of Mary B., i.e. she has a split personality. But, no, the book is saying that there are two Maries...not one with a good and bad side. If you want to read a lot of fairly interesting courtroom questioning by prosecutor and def. atty, most of the book is irrelevantly devoted to this, so read it and enjoy an O.J. moment. Perhaps the worst mystery/suspense novel I have ever read. This is my fourth and last McBain novel. HIs stories read at supersonic speed and purposefully divert the reader from thinking about the plot, characters, conflict,etc. Recommended solely for no-depth crowd of mystery readers (90% of readers are in this category; hence, the popularity ofjames patterson, Sue Grafton, Kellerman's,and many more; can anyone actually read Elizabeth George's prose and not become constipated and nauseous). Also, irrelevant romance between Mary's defense atty and female prosecutor. Added nothing to story, except perhaps to be a lame red herring that the femme fatale might have something to do with the murders.

review/text: I knew there was something missing from the first book when I read it, because it didn't match what I heard her say years ago when she came to my church to speak. Now I know, the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it. Later, with the help of a trusted friend, she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience. This what the second book is about. The most wonderful thing about Dorie, is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life. She is still able to have a successful and happy life, in spite of the horrendous abuse of her childhood. This is what so many women need to hear. With the Lord's help, it is possible!

This is one of a set of books geared toward educating the person, the counselor, as well as the general public in the harms caused by sexual abuse, but it also highlights the resilency of the person who has gone through it.

Some of it is good,while some of it will never vibrate my speakers again.Drum fans will enjoy the variety of excellent drummers. If you want to get into Brand X, this is not the best place to start( go back to the late 70`s stuff).

review/text: Ever put on a record and known exactly what year it was recorded just by the sound ? Well, if not, try slapping this one on your turntable ... it literally screams mid-1980s. Needless to say, depending on your age and perspective, that may or may not be a good thing. So in the case of Ty Brunson's "Fresh" it'll depend on how you feel about mid-1980s funk complete with all of the ingredients - banks of synthesizers,, syndrums, pop bass, vocoders, etc... Anyhow, Ty Brunson's a local product, so my comments may be a bit biased ... as always, take them with a grain of salt.Born and raised in Washington, D.C.. Brunson's first taste of recognition came as a member of Osiris Marsh's funk band Osiris/Osiris the Band. A more than decent late-1970s DC-based funk outfit, they were quite popular locally, but never enjoyed that breakout hit. As the band's bassist Brunson struck out on his own in 1980, subsequently signing a solo deal by the Columbia-distributed Believe In a Dream label.Produced by Russell Timmons Jr., "Fresh" was Brunson's sophomore album. To be perfectly honest, it was far from the most original set you've ever heard. Musically the set offered up a mixture of Larry Graham-styled funk numbers ('Head Games') and conventional 'love man' ballads (''In Love with You'). Taken individually most of the seven tracks were actually pretty good, but the set's main downfall was the complete absence of originality. This was literally one of those albums where you spent the whole time thinking to yourself "that sounds like ..." Giving credit where due, Brunson had a nice voice (except when he tried to sound Jamaican ('Jet City') and was a decent bassist, though that talent was seldom spotlighted on the album.- Opening up with an arsenal of 1980s sound effects, including some of the cheesiest synthesizers you've heard in a long time, syndrums, vocoders, banks of chirping female backing singers, 'Servo Go-Go' sounded like something out of the George Clinton funk family. A hardcore funk track, it was catchy enough, but felt like it had been built out of spare parts - steal a Bootsy Collins bass line here, borrow a P-Funk sound effect there ... rating: ** stars- Showcasing Brunson's likeable voice, 'In Love with You' was a pedestrian old school ballad. Pretty enough, the track actually would have sound pretty good on top-40 radio. His label seemed to think the same, releasing the track as a promotion 12" single. rating: *** stars- 'Head Games' found Brunson bouncing back to hardcore funk. Sounding like something out of Larry Graham's early catalog, the track was interesting for showcasing Brunson's pop bass skills, but even those were largely buried under the burping synthesizers. rating: *** stars- A collaboration with singer Ethel Beatty, 'Don't Wanna Stop Lovin'' offered up the album's second ballad. Thanks to a nice vocal from Brunson, I actually liked this one better than 'In Love with You'. Unfortunately, the effect was largely trashed by Beatty who sounded like she was a 15 year old version of Minnie Ripperton. rating: ** stars- Offering up a mixture of funk and jazz-rock moves, the instrumental 'Fresh' was probably the album's most interesting number. That probably explains why it was tapped as the lead-off single. For anyone interested, YouTube has a promotion video clip of the track. [...] rating: **** stars- The album's weirdest track, 'Jet City' found Brunson trying out reggae ... nice try, but not a genre that was particularly suited for his skills set. rating: ** stars- A pedestrian, formulaic slice of funk, 'At the Show' was basically DOA. rating: * starThere was certainly talent here, but you had to look long and hard to find it amongst all the wannabe influences.As mentioned, the album was tapped for a couple of singles:- 1984's 'Fresh' b/w 'Fresh (scratch mix)' (Believe In a Dream catalog number 4Z9 04951) # 22 (R&B;)- 1984's 'I'm In Love with You' b/w 'I'm In Love with You' (Believe In a Dream catalog number 4Z9 05007) 12" promo releaseWhile the first single went top-40 on the R&B; charts (Brunson's last chart success), the parent LP vanished without a trace."Fresh" track listing:(side 1)1.) Servo Go-Go (Tyrone Brunson) - 5:382.) In Love with You (Tyrone Brunson - M. Morgan) - 4:293.) Head Games (Tyrone Brunson) - 4:444.) Don't Wanna Stop Lovin' (L. Kirton - B. Eastmond) - 4:45(side 2)1.) Fresh (instrumental) (Tyrone Brunson - M. Bond - B. Eastmond) - 4:202.) Jet City (Tyrone Brunson) - 5:203.) At the Show (Tyrone Brunson - M.

review/summary: This was an intriguing book that influenced my destiny.
review/text: I read &quot;Trouble on Titan&quot; around 1970, when the Apollo program was at its apex, and the human exploration of the Solar System seemed only a short step away. My review is based on old memories, but I can still remember a mining colony on Titan and jet craft using oxygen for fuel and burning Titan's methane atmosphere. We've learned much since this book was written, and Titan's atmosphere has less methane than we originally thought. However, this book was well written, and I am sure will intrigue my son as much as it intrigued his father, who is now working at NASA on the Cassini/Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan. This book has that old-style sci-fi flavor that made another world seem more like reality than fantasy. I think if you enjoyed the Lucky Starr and David Starr stories by Asimov, you will enjoy &quot;Trouble on Titan.&quot;

review/summary: On reflection, what do you think of it now?
review/text: Twelve years after the first review, and Cassini is there. It's Spring on Titan, and it's raining methane. Hydrocarbons are lying about on the surface, in pools larger than the great lakes. Just by dumb luck, the place turns out to be almost exactly how Nourse imagined it. What a piece of work is Man. Especially that one.I read it in 1960, and could see then that it's not really about sports-rockets (although there is a cool one). It's everything a "juvenile" could ever be, with a father-son rapprochement, East-is-East friendships that grow between opposite equals, first love, labor trouble, industrial sabotage, and a rebellion conspiracy. When I first read Heinlein later that year, I thought he suffered by comparison. I was eight at the time.

review/summary: Nice quality, but will not stack well
review/text: My grandson is only 10 months old, so right now, he enjoys shaking and looking at the blocks. What I am disappointed in is the fact that they will not stack very well at all. He tried to put one on the other and it falls right off. They are slippery and not formed so that they can be stacked without falling off each other. Maybe I'm "old school", but I think blocks should be for education with alphabet and even more so, for stacking ability. They are cute, well made, and I will use them as a learning tool for the alphabet with the figures that represent each letter inside the block, but I guess we won't be stacking them!I got a better price buying directly from the fisher price web site catalog. (about $30 with shipping)

review/summary: Love these modern ABC blocks with the little objects inside for extra interest
review/text: I do love these blocks that I bought for my 13 month old grandson for Christmas but later found out that this particular group of peek a blocks doesn't interact with the big cube that my daughter bought for Christmas. It came with its own group of 8 blocks that do interact with the cube but there are other peek a block groups such as the vehicles, jungle animals, farm animals, ABCs. It would have been nice, really rather, e xpected that the ABC blocks especially would have been interactive with the main system and would have announced the name of the letter when that block was affixed onto the activation port, but they don't. I think there may be music played , but that's all. Only the 8 blocks that came with the large cube system are programmed into it.

review/summary: Peek a Fun!
review/text: We got these as a gift for our one year old. He loves them! He tries very hard to get all the little things out of the blocks - and obviously fails. He loves that some of them move, some of them jiggle, some of them make noise - its almost an adventure!The three year old also loves them because they incorporate the alphabet and he can easily identify the items inside: B - Banana, P - Penguin, U - Umbrella, Z - Zebra.Bonus - when the 1 y/o gets frustrated because he can't pry the items out of the block no matter how hard he tries, he usually flings them. The 3 y/o tends to use them to build walls or towers for the sole purpose of smashing another toy into them, or dropping them off high places. And I've stepped on two of them already. They seem to tolerate this treatment rather well.

review/summary: A must have for little ones everywhere!
review/text: My little boy received these as a present on his 1st Birthday. I was a bit worried he would find these boring as he is a very picky boy when it comes to toys.To make this short and sweet, he LOVES these so much!!!I can't imagine not having them now. He adores when I stack them up for him and he knocks them down. He spends a lot of time just shaking them, studying them and handing them to me so I can look at them. He is very proud of his blocks and sometimes throws them on to the wood floor to get my attention. This said, thy are super durable and after much abuse have lived to tell the tale without cracks or coming apart.He also enjoys using these with other toys and will store them in the container type toys.The little objects inside are very cute and some of them move if you turn the little hole on the bottom. (My little one hasn't learned how to do this yet.) The birds make a squeak noise when you push in the bottom and the train is my favorite as it goes round & in a tunnel. A lot of thought were put in these and it shows.An all around wonderful toy!

review/text: Highly recommended. My 16mo daughter has these alphabet blocks plus many of the additional peek-a-block sets. She loves to take each block out of the bin, examine it, and get the next one. This can go on for 20+ minutes, which is hours in toddler land. She has enjoyed playing with them since she was about 9 months old. Each block is so unique and interactive that the set easily captures her interest. We also have the IncrediBlock and other compatible Fisher Price toys. Like any other blocks, they're great for stacking and knocking down. We recently had several parents of similarly aged kids visit our house and they all thought this was a great toy. I love playing with them, too!

review/text: These are clever, cute, colorful, and fun for even mom and dad. He plays with them every day, each one with a different shape, sounds, activity... They were the perfect size for 6-9 mos hands as he learned to grasp, and as he's gotten older, he's more captivated by what's inside or what they do. We just bought more for his first birthday to add to the alphabet set, and I expect that we'll collect additional sets in the next year via auction sites. Just a super buy that I'm glad that we found for our son.

review/text: We got these after seeing the Incrediblocks in the FP Catalog.There are little to no pizazz to the blocks. Some have features where you can "spin" them (like the letter Q - Queen) or the W (watermelon seeds that rattle) - but most are just a "look at me" type of a block.With that in mind - yes I like the product. They're blocks. They're meant for stacking, knocking over and banging - which my son loves (he's had these since he was 6 months). They're better than the plain wooden blocks because they're textured, they have objects inside, letters - lots of opportunities to learn letters, colors, objects, descriptions, etc.For now he's stacking, banging and knocking over. It'll be around for a while until he's ready to learn more words, colors, objects, animals. This review isn't profound or eye openings because again - they're just blocks. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. It will not make your child an overnight rocket scientist =)

My 9 month old enjoys shaking the ones with little pieces inside (like the u for umbrella has little white pellets representing rain). I love all the thought and detail that went into each block. My friend with the older child says she loves them because you can really talk about each block with your child, instead of a regular one dimensional block. Those conversations are huge for language development, teaching colors, aninimals, a whole variety of new words, etc. Buy them! They also make a fantastic unique gift for a friends child. Very well put togethe/durable. I admit, I even enjoy looking at each one to see what the designers came up with.

review/summary: They're thrown, stacked, washed, banged, and not damaged!
review/text: My 15 month old hasn't gotten her hands on these yet (saving for Christmas) but her little friend has a set, and I've been told that they stand up to a LOT of abuse. Our set was sent on time, but I noticed that some of the little toys inside the blocks seem a little dirty. IDK how this could be, since the blocks are sealed so that little ones can't get into the small pieces inside. Guess I'll update this review after my little one gets her hands on these.Update, 8/5/12: My now-16 month old LOVES these little things! She's able to identify the letters through the toys inside them ("find D for ducky!"). She hasn't tried stacking them yet, but they get thrown around and scattered (one survived a throw outside onto asphalt with nary a scratch). I would recommend to anyone with an active toddler! Oh, and they also amuse them during diaper changes -- another plus!

review/summary: Fun selection of blocks! Great alternative to the traditional alphabet blocks
review/text: I love the Peek-a-blocks sets that are out there and I was excited to see the alphabet set available. Every child should have a set of alphabet blocks and these are so much more fun than the basic wood ones. A few people have said that the letter obstructs what is inside, but I don't really agree. While they do have the letter on the one side, you get three other sides to view the inside object just fine. And isn't the point of the alphabet block the letter anyway? It is nice that it comes in a reusable case with a handle too. Just make sure and do your research before you bought. I did some digging around online and got this set for only $25!

review/summary: Great Blocks
review/text: My daughter loves her blocks. She will get them all out and look at each one until she finds her favorite. She likes to shake them and see what each one does. These are cute little blocks that have hours of imaginative playtime inside. They also have blunt corners, so no sharp edges like wood blocks for the safety of smaller children. The fact that they have the letters of the alphabet and a corresponding object inside makes them a great learning tool even for older tots. We have really enjoyed these and recommend them to our friends.

review/summary: Great for kids and parents alike!!!
review/text: When I was in my early teen years, my mom had a set of these for a couple of the kids she babysat. I liked to even then play with these blocks with the kids because they were so interactive and had lots of variety. Now that I'm a dad, I decided that our little 8 month old should have a set to play with. His eyes lit up when seeing them and really loves is when daddy builds them into a tower that he can come an knock down. I'm sure that they are going to be used for years and years to come.They are super durable. The plastic is hard and the pieces are fit together so well that I doubt that they will every come apart without a significant amount of effort by an adult. They are a bit pricey but I feel that they are worth the investment as they will be toys I expect my grandkids to be able to play with someday.

review/text: I bought these blocks for my daughter as a birthday gift and when I received them in the mail there were two "V" blocks and the "T" block was missing. These blocks are so cool, but you might want to make sure the alphabet is correct before wrapping it up as a gift for a child. However, they are the neatest blocks I've ever seen, so it was definitely worth sending them back for a different one.

review/summary: Better than I expected
review/text: I purchased Peek-A-Blocks for both my 1-year old niece and my 8-month old nephew. The nephew lives across the country, so I can't evaluate his opinion of the product. However, my 1-year old niece just loves these blocks. Her 5-year old sister loves them too. The younger niece can easily grab hold of the blocks, and she loves the bright colors. The older niece loves to stack them.The blocks are much more interactive than I first thought they would be. Sure, some of the blocks have loose plastic balls within, and some items are mounted on bouncy springs. However, it's not obvious from the packaging that many other blocks have rotating bases, which allow items within to move around. For example, one block has a train that rotates in and out of a mountain tunnel. There are other nice touches. For example, tapping the fish block causes the fish within to appear as though they are swimming.Lastly, I want to point out an initial hesitation I had about buying these blocks -- a hesitation which turned out to be of no real concern. Years ago, I bought a set of 6 peek-a-blocks for a friend's son. At that time, the blocks were sold in themed sets of 6 blocks (sports, machines, etc). More recently, Fisher Price did away with the smaller sets, replacing them with one large set of 26 blocks, each with a printed alphabet letter on one side. (C = car, D = duck, H = horse, etc.) Anyway, I initially hesitated buying the newer set of Alphabet Peek-A-Blocks, because I thought the alphabet letters would obstruct a child's ability to see the content of the block. However, as I have already mentioned, many blocks allow the contents to be rotated, such that the printed letter no longer blocks a child's view of the content within.In concluding, I am very pleased with the purchase. The kids are too.

review/summary: More fun than you might expect.
review/text: My husband and I bought these blocks as extras for the Incrediblock we'd purchased for our then nine-month-old son. While my son wasn't (and still isn't) wowed by the Incrediblock (you can see my review on that page), he does enjoy playing with the Alphabet Blocks.I like the fact that each block has a big capital letter, and inside, something that starts with that letter; for example, the "D" block has a dog. We'll be able to use these blocks for a long time because of that; I can imagine spending time with my son and teaching him that "C" is for cat -- and he'll be able to see both to make that association.My son, on the other hand, couldn't care less at this point about the letters of the alphabet (he'll soon be one year old), but he does enjoy stacking and knocking over the blocks, banging them together, and especially shaking the ones that make noise. One of his favorites is the "I" block, which has an ice cream sundae inside with lots of sprinkles that rattle merrily when he shakes it.All in all, this is a good, affordable, durable, educational and fun set of blocks. My family continues to be very pleased with them.

review/summary: Great to add to your collection, but not the best Peek-a-Blocks
review/text: I really love all the Fisher Price Peek a Blocks---I saw them long before I knew we'd have a surprise #3 baby and I would actually have an excuse to buy them! Now we own pretty much all the sets. I would have to say this set, although big, is one of the weaker ones. The letters on the sides sometimes block seeing what's inside too well, and the toys inside are not as interactive or interesting as is the case with some of these blocks---for example, a horse that just sits there, a zylophone that doesn't move much, an apple that turns. I like their blocks with tiny things to shake inside or the like---the kind of things babies can't generally play with as they are too small, but that are made safe by being enclosed! Also, having ABCs is most just a way to have a set here I think---unless you are very into early learning, I don't think most babies are really ready to associate the letters with the toys inside (I know SOME babies are, but not that many, and not mine!) However, all this said, I still would say to buy this set, if you know you like this kind of block---It's great to add 26 more in one fell swoop!

review/summary: Pretty good deal but could be more exciting
review/text: I bought these blocks for my daughter when she was 9 months old and she really only enjoys them now. She is 14 months now and is starting to recognize some of the objects inside when I ask her to get them. But be warned bc they're not great for the real younger babies since there are only a few of them that really do anything like beep or rattle. Most of them just have a stationary object that may jiggle a bit. The ones that you can twist yourself are not child-friendly. She can't turn the knob at all so she gets frustrated. My 3 yr old can just do it. He likes them too bc they incorporate the alphabet. Another thing is that the printed letters block some of the objects so it's harder to see inside. I would more so recommend a diff set for a younger baby (6 mos)- like the sound sensations and these for an older child (1 yr). Although you can't beat the price for 26 of these blocks! I also just recently got the Roll-A-Rounds by fisher price as a gift. It's the same concept but a ball vs block. She likes them ALOT!

review/summary: Never Too Old
review/text: After "eyeing" this toy for several months and being hesitant to buy it because of the cost, we finally broke bown and purchased it when our daughter was 15 months old. We're very glad we did!Our daughter loves shaking the blocks, banging them together and knocking over the blocks after we stack them up for her. She really likes putting them all into a plastic bin and then taking them all out again! The letter written on each block is meaningless to her right now, but that time will come.We plan to keep these blocks for a few years. As our daughter approaches school age, the blocks will be a great tool to help teach and reinforce letter-sound association. We believe she may never be too old to benefit from her Peek-A-Boo blocks. We know we're not!Consider donating your set to a local library or school when you're done with them.

review/text: This is a great set of blocks. I researched different blocks for some time and found these to be the most durable, age and developmentally-appropriate, and highly-educational. $25 bucks may seem like a lot, but I think it is well worth it. I am very impressed with the quality.The size and shape of the blocks is just right. My son is 5-months old and he is able to hold the blocks perfectly in his little hands. PLUS, the blocks do not have sharp corners (like the wooden blocks also available on this site) that could hurt your little one (especially those of you with chewers!).One category that I rated this toy with only a 4 (instead of 5) is the "fun" factor. For younger babies that may not "get it" yet, this toy may not be as fun for them until they are a little bit older. My son is not yet able to fully comprehend that there are even toys inside the blocks, but then again he is only 5 months. Give him a couple of months and he'll really dig them!

review/summary: What a great idea!
review/text: This is my first experience with peek-a-boo blocks. I bought this set for my nephew for his 1st birthday and he's absolutely nuts about them. He does all the obvious baby stuff like grasping and chewing and scattering them but he also closely examines what is inside - I can almost see the neurons firing in his little brain. Of course the letters are meaningless right now and yes they might somewhat obstruct the view to the little thing inside but so what? He eventually learns different levels of focus; layers of education.Pricey? Well, that depends. My 3-year old niece loves the blocks just as much and they have deeper meaning for her because she knows all the letters to the alphabet and that the little thing inside the block starts with the letter that's printed on it. Like I said, layers of education. Well worth $25 in my opinion.Oh how I wish I would have known about this type of product when my kids were babies. My son would have loved them. The only reason I rated it as a 4-star as opposed to a 5 is that I am unaware of the availability of other peek-a-boo products. I cannot rate it as "best" when I have nothing to compare it to. Highly recommended

review/text: Bought these for my baby along with the Incrediblock. The blocks are adorable, but when you put them on the Incrediblock, it doesn't make individual letter sounds for them, which is what I expected for the price.It turns out that only the 13 blocks that come with the Incrediblock make any kind of individual noises. These just play random music, which is fine, but I really bought this for the purposes of it being a really educational toy, which it really isn't at this point.The description really should explicitly tell you this.

review/summary: Orca Wisdom as told by Mary Getten
review/text: Whales in the dreams of children, whale spirituality, whale sex and whale governance are all things we'll not likely get from scientific researchers for decades, perhaps a century or two. That is one reason the new book by Mary Getten, a Naturalist specializing in the wildlife of the San Juan Islands and a practicing animal communicator is so brilliant. This is not for folks who think that actual communication with whales (or other critters) is impossible. Those folks are probably the same people who get angry at their dogs for not doing what they are told.Mary herself was once a skeptic, as she relates in "Communicating with Orcas: The Whales' Perspective". At her first animal communication workshop, facilitated by Penelope Smith, Mary was given the task to communicate with Pirouette, Penelope's cockatiel:"I knew nothing about birds. Mammals were my passion, and I had nointerest in delicate little avians. Truthfully, I was a little frightened of them, yet here I was face to face with a cockatiel and it was time for us to talk.I looked into her bright white face, admiring the crest of yellow feathers on her forehead and the orange dot on her cheek. Drinking in her features, I relaxed and thought, this won't be too tough. She seems nice enough. So I began to think about what to say to her.This is where it all went downhill. I didn't have a clue what to say to a bird. You would have though that I'd spent my entire life locked into a closet. Not a single question appeared. Time ticked by and I knew I had to so something, so I kept repeating: "Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette."Finally, I stopped for a moment to think of something else to say, and clear as a bell I heard Pirouette say: "Can't you say anything but hello?"Humor, backed with good science and historical tidbits going back to Aristotle and Pliny The Elder balance the presentation for those who are a little reticent to believe in this mode of communication. (This skepticism persists even in the wake of breakthrough research by famed scientist Rupert Sheldrake.) Mary's writing is clear and accessible and the stories of whale sex are quite funny. I mean laugh-out-loud, drool on the PAGE funny.Yet, the skepticism that Mary had when first learning to communicate with animals is the book's biggest weakness, in my view. I was fascinated by the notion of Ruffles, the male elder of the Southern Puget Sound resident community's J Pod, visiting the dreams of schoolchildren who had been on whale-watching cruises. The notion that our species, the lowly Homo sapiens, is at the beginning of a new wave of consciousness that will see remarkable innovations in bodies and senses, or that of the whale councils, the ability to live in past lives (though whales don't call them that) and their description of the universal life force as "The Prime Cause," are all subjects that fascinate me, but the book only teases with these concepts. Perhaps a sequel is called for.However, these are pretty far-out concepts for the average reader and when it comes down to it, Mary has covered the basics in a thorough manner with a wicked wit. If you have the least bit of interest in Orcas, you will be able to read this book in a weekend.May we all be able to live in the moment like these whales have for thousands of years. Their intelligence is much needed in these days when our allegedly more intelligent species, can't get beyond such insanity as war and environmental degradation.Paul Nelson

review/summary: Open your mind and your heart!
review/text: This book is one of the most profound and wonderful books I have ever had the pleasure of reading! It's a beautiful true story that tells of two animal communicators, Mary and her good friend Raphaela, and their conversations with Granny. Granny is a 92 (est.) year-old orca who lives in the Pacific Northwest with her family, J Pod. During Mary and Raphaela's time conversing with Granny, they question her on many aspects of orca life from finding food to orca spirituality. Granny relays a very important message to the human race in this book. A message that MUST NOT be overlooked! This book should be read and emabraced by all. Granny's words certainly opened my eyes and made me see things in a different light. Open your mind and your heart. Read this book!

review/summary: Communication at its Best!!
review/text: When I first picked up the book, Communicating with Orcas by Mary Getten, I was mildly interested in learning about Orca whales. After reading the first few pages I found that I could not put this book down until I had finished reading it. This book is awesome, entertaining, witty, and written from a totally unique whale's perspective which can not help but captivate you. Communicating with Orcas is skillfully presented to communicate points that Granny wishes to make about the life of whales, her profound observations of the human race, and the essential roll that the whales play in raising the consciousness of the earth. Before reading this book, I would never have entertained the idea that communication with a whale or any other animal for that matter could indeed be possible. One has to be able to accept that things do exist that are not readily proven or explained by Newtonian scientific theories. The insight provided in this book will truly astound you. Many past cultures had a closeness to nature that has been lost in today's world. This book takes a refreshing step back into what was and is still possible if we are open to believing

review/text: This is well worth the read if only to gain information about the pods of Orcas that are resident around the San Juan Islands. But well beyond that, whether or not one accepts the author's ability to communicate with the orcas, what she relates about the wisdom of whales (primarily Granny, the 90+year old leader of J pod) is a wake-up call for humanity.

review/text: Whale naturalist and animal communicator Mary Getten goes beyond what other research has achieved in the way of whale study and communication processes: in 1991 she studied the J-Pod, a family of whales off Washington State. Her contention that they use direct telepathic communication between themselves and can do so with humans also makes for fascinating reading.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch

review/text: I found this book amazing. I'm from Michigan and we "Michiganders" tend to think about lakes not oceans. This book opened my eyes to a new way of thinking about the world. It also made me start to think about the oceans creatures in more than just a "far away" way. If you do believe in animal communiation you will find this book to be a wonderfully different type of perspective. If you think animal communication is a "bunch of nonsense" this book may seem really strange to you, but it also makes you start to think "What if the whales do think, What if other animals think, what would they think of us and our running, running rather than enjoying and loving life" I highly recommend this book to all!!

review/text: I LOVED Mary Getten's book "Communicating with Orcas". I couldn't put it down. Reading it, my sense of life's inter-connectedness was profoundly deepened. After I read this book I looked at all life with new eyes and a new heart.I was touched by Getten's love and respect for the Orcas and her courage to share this information with the world. I mean, where else are you going to learn about, among other things, whale sex from their perspective!!!? Her conversations with Granny made me laugh at times, cry at others. They changed me.I have given this book as a gift to several friends and find myself lending out my copy frequently. Reading this book fosters a new reverence for life. Sharing this book with others is one way I work to bring healing to the earth.

review/summary: Great Piece of Scientific Journalism
review/text: i guess there are still come people out there who feel that telepathic communication with animals is impossible. They must not live with pets! I live with 3 dogs and i KNOW we communicate. One thing that is great about this book is that Mary Getten is a scientist, and brings that objectivity to her studies of the orcas. She enlists another communicator, Raphaela Pope, so that they can confirm each other's information. I found this book to be a very well-rounded piece of scientific journalism, they interviewed their subjects on many different topics to present an in-depth view of life from a whales's perpective. I haven't spent much time with whales but this book was a great introduction, probably the best!!

This book is informative, funny, insightful and filled with the kind of respect all the sentient beings deserve. Her book is a glimpse of how well Mary "listens"not only to the cetaceans but all her animal clients. It's heartfelt and honest.Mary's encounters had me steeped in the experience.. It was as if I was right there.I could feel the whales on every page and it made me cry.If you love whales this will take you straight into their world!!! What a great ride!!Thank God people are finally waking up to the truth about communicating with animals..It's about time.. they have so much to teach us.. certainly we can't be that arrogant!!!

review/summary: Not Convinced...
review/text: I got this book about 3 years ago, and I was really excited, because I got it for Christmas. Little did I realise I was actually getting a narative about a woman who says she can telepathically communicate with animals.Now, don't get me wrong. I have done research into the telepathic Animal Communication, even as a freshman in college right now I have done more research into it. And even though there seems to be something, I have yet to see a bonified scientific study followed by a scientific peer reviewed paper on these experiences people have. And even as a person going into a minor Psychology I know that Psychological and behavioral studies are very difficult, becuase of the amazing amount of variables that are caused by the extremely complex brain, alone. But even I can not take much of this at face value.I believe her, I don't think she is lying. I question the validity of the actual communication. Is she really linking mentally to this orca, or is this her not fully understanding the duality that many people fall into, and is she thinking that is J2 (or Granny we call her) talking to her?I really want to give her credit and I really wanted to believe her, but I can't. She didn't give me much to really grab onto as a convincing argument for her so called abilities. And she is not the first animal communicator I have done a little research on. There was one woman mentioned in "Freeing Keiko" who said that whales and dolphins were essentially extraterrestrial beings that were guiding the earth through space. Another woman said that Greyhound dogs were also extraterrestrial beings.Just the simple fact that there is glaring inconstancies between different animal communicators should be enough evidence that there really isn't too much, if anything, to Telepathic Animal Communication.It was an entertianing book, I rather enjoyed it. But I am a sceptic. And being a sceptic I would be completely honest about my position. If something really seems to make sense, I will say it does. But this book didn't. And saying that, I would not be talking about this book to my friends or family. If it does turn up in conversation, it will most likely be during our psuedopyschological studies. That is unless someone can show me a real study that is so sound as to prove me wrong. To which, if it did prove me wrong I would say so.

I have just placed an order for my second Cory Everson's Total Body Workout as I am fearful that my first one will wear out. If inside exercise generally bores you to tears, Cory alleviates the problem.This is a fast paced workout with enough variety to keep you entertained. She includes a warm-up and cool down, trouble zone toning,strength training,step training and circuit training, everything a woman needs to maintain a healthy body in just one hour. It does require a step, for step aerobics, and hand held weights, but there are no gimics, no annoying music or irritating voices just a thoroughly enjoyable workout.

review/text: This was the second of Cory's tapes that I have purchased and was equally if not more so, disappointed. Not having the opportunity to view it, I purchased it based on customer ratings from Amazon. If music and environment is important to you, this is not the right video. The music is not aligned at all with the movement, and either is her counting. Though there are five sections for a full body workout, the exercises are jerky and inefficient. There is no pre-instruction or notice prior to each exercise in addition to little to no safety in the movements or shifting from one to another. Though Cory's reputation with regard to her bodybuilding is well noted, I will not be purchasing any other tapes from her collection. It is the first &quot;instructor of tapes I have noted, wearing evening gown length earrings in her workouts and she and the members of her training look more like first timers for the Playboy collection than serious and directed workout members. Their &quot;bums&quot; are bare for the workouts. All these factors combined, I find them more &quot;show&quot; than anything else.

But that in fact, they are merely stating unpopular views, and are in fact simply being honest.Unfortunately, the truth is that these folks are totally dishonest. And, in some cases, they are unpatriotic as well. On top of that, some of them unequivocally support right-wing Islamic fanaticism. What they frequently appear to want is not academic freedom but the right to engage in academic dishonesty, often in a misguided attempt to hurt a few Jews.We start with a spectacularly dishonest article by Beshara Doumani. He moans that "pro-Israel lobbying groups" and others are "policing what can be said about Israel on campus and in public discourse." Obviously, anyone who has been on a few major American campuses can see that the anti-Israeli folks have been far more effective at doing just this. He says that Lawrence Summers "effectively equated criticism of Israel's policies with anti-Semitism." That's a lie. He then defends the infamous anti-Israeli professors at Columbia University, who in real life substitute racist propaganda for scholarship in the classroom. And he dismisses criticism of this attack on academic standards as the work of right-wing groups, pro-Israeli groups, and donors. Even if some criticism of all this dishonesty were from such groups, that would not invalidate it! He tells us to speak and act before it is too late. I suggest we all do just that, and speak out against him.There are a couple of interesting discussions about the extent to which a professor's "extracurricular" work should be protected. My feeling is that it should be. Noam Chomsky is used as an example. I happen to think that Chomsky ought to have a right to tell outright lies as part of his extracurricular activities as long as he does not commit any felonies. Others feel differently about this, and still others feel that even outright academic dishonesty in one's professional work ought to be okay (something I disagree with completely).By the way, speaking of felonies, we do see a reference that Sami al-Arian was "disciplined for a statement concerning terrorism." But no mention is made of the enormous amount of evidence that al-Arian had long been a terrorist leader. In fact, that evidence finally got al-Arian fired. Are we now supposed to excuse felons, dismissing their crimes under the mantle of academic freedom? I hope not.Judith Butler repeats the slander that "any criticism of Israel" is called anti-Semitic by quite a few folks. And she complains about criticism of the notorious International Solidarity Movement. If she wants to make a case for something, I think she ought to be far more honest. Kathleen Frydl attacks the idea of withholding funding from universities if their expenditures promote "violence, terrorism, or the destruction of any state." Now, maybe the wording of such an idea needs some work. But I think it is completely proper to try to stop universities from spending taxpayer money on pro-terrorist propaganda.Amy Newhall is worried about the United States attaching strings to some language programs. But I think she's the problem here. There are programs that the United States government supports to teach, for example, Arabic in universities. The government does so in the hopes that at least a few students in such programs will use their knowledge of the language to work for the government. If the university encourages them not to do so and we wind up without any benefit from those programs, I think there is no reason to continue them: let the universities use their own money to teach Arabic in that case.Perhaps the most vicious article is by Joel Beinin. Beinin seems to attack everyone who opposes the substitution of dishonest propaganda for scholarly work, calling such opposition the work of people he dubs "the American Likud." He says "this is not the first time right-wing fanatics have waged a campaign of vilification, guilt by association, guilt by ethnic or religious affiliation, and delegitimization of dissenting opinions." And in this regard, he mentions HUAC and Joe McCarthy. But in fact, it is Beinin himself who is doing all this, in the service of right-wing fanatics no less. A special target of Beinin is a particularly praiseworthy organization, Campus Watch. This organization exposes some of the disinformation and incitement we see on campus, but Beinin claims that what it reports is "false and brazenly bigoted." It is neither. Once again, Beinin appears to accuse others of what he himself is guilty of.This book pretends to be defending academia. In fact, it is defending academic dishonesty. This dishonesty is a threat to ruin the reputations of plenty of academic departments and possibly discredit entire fields of study. I think we should all encourage the academic community to fight against such violations of academic standards.

review/summary: calm, and quite pretty, but massive
review/text: Best known as the bearded, kinda imposing guitarist/vocalist/viking in the art-metal institution known as Neurosis, Steve Von Till is always working on other projects as well... Harvestman being his latest musical incarnation (with help from friends, including members of Amber Asylum), devoted to making psychedelic, electronic spacerock with a traditional folk heritage. It's like pagans were picked up at Stonehenge by an alien spaceship and deposited on some far off planet aeons hence to make music on futuristic instruments (that we call electric guitars and synthesizers).Lashing The Rye is mostly instrumental, with just two female vocal visitations and (on one song) the sampled voice of Bert Jansch. Also SVT "narrates" on one track, a la Current 93 or something. The twelve tracks here may have titles like "Scarborough Fair" and "Sheep-Crook and Black Dog" (Harvestman's renderings of those two inspired by versions recorded by John Renbourn and Steeleye Span, respectively) but while many of the tunes here may be traditional, Harvestman's interpretation and instrumentation sure ain't! Though there's some delicate guitar and piano (and searing bagpipe) this isn't all that "acoustic" -- there's also plenty of droning electronic spaciness and heavy waves of distorted electric guitar. It's calm, and quite pretty, but massive. Folk-drone for giants. Imagine Amps For Christ teamed up with Kinski. Parts even hint at the density of SUNNO))) or Boris. Recommended!

review/summary: Excellent Side Project from the Neurosis Crew
review/text: This album is a great album by Steve Von Till and collaborators, comparable to his previous adventures like Static Migration with Tribes of Neurot and his Fist Solo Album As the Crow Flies. Very beautiful and Hypnotic, with good melodies and trance like moments through out the album. some of the tracks even reminiscent of Souls at Zero Neurosis. Track twelve has to be my favorite track, because you can not go wrong with bagpipes. If you are a fan of neurosis and tribes of neurot, this is a good blend inbetween the ambient sounds of tribes and the metal sounds of neurosis. highly recommended.

review/summary: Review from Hi-Fi News &amp; Record Review October 1996
review/text: At last, a performance of Saint-Sans's 'Organ Symphony' fit to stand alongside those of Munch (New York Philharmonic or Boston SO), Paray and the Detroit Symphony, or Toscanini with the NBC. . . Under Djong Victorin Yu the work is played straight for all it is worth, the exultant glories of Nicholas Kynaston's organ playing blending with the enviable and immediately identifiable tonal sheen that the Philharmonia has retained right to its 50th year. For once the ending of the work is not slowed down for effect. And doesn't it sound good!Carnival of the Animals is memorable on several counts: the unanimity of ensemble between the orchestra and the two remarkable young pianists (Youngho and Jinho Kim); the inclusion of a glass harmonica (Alasdair Malloy) in 'Aquarium', giving the effect of an underwater dreamworld; and the majestic use of the whole doublebass section in 'Elephant'. . .The fabulous recording, made at the Royal Festival Hall by Jonathan Wearn, captures all the excitement and all the colours with sparkling clarity and immediacy. You can't get better than this.

review/summary: Review from Gramophone March 1996
review/text: Few pieces of music in the history of the gramophone can have suffered such indignities at the hands of insensitive record producers as Saint-Sans's Third Symphony. A glance through the catalogues might suggest one is spoiled for choice, but to date I have only found two recordings which do full justice to the work. Now here's a third, although altogether different. . . this is a recording which not only deserves repeated listening but positively demands it. Yu reveals just what a magnificent piece of music this is; shorn of its customary sonic spectacle the brilliant craftsmanship of Saint-Sans's writing is displayed in unimpeded glory. . .In The Carnival of the animals . . . Yu opts for the version for large orchestra complete with glass harmonica (adeptly played by Alasdair Malloy), and while it is again characterized by meticulous attention to detail, it is also a performance full of buoyant wit. . .

review/summary: Pretty good, although a few flaws
review/text: This is, all-around, a pretty good lawn book. However, there are a few cases where the advice is a little outdated given the latest research on the subject.One is the subject of using a mulching mower; research has shown that using a mulching mower does not contribute significantly to thatch buildup. Finely chopped grass clippings from lawn grasses decompose very rapidly. I guess you might get in trouble if you have lots of aggressive weed grasses that grow extremely rapidly, leaving much larger amounts of grass clippings. It is also possible that using a non-mulching mower could get you in trouble; it sounds like Mr. Baker might be using a reel mower, which doesn't pulverize the leaves. The research that I have seen studied the effects of using a mulching mower on lawn grass only, so if you have loads of tall weed grasses, or are using a non-mulching mower, you might have trouble.Another is the subject of aeration. From what I have read, spike aeration (Mr. Baker recommends the use of those spike aerator sandal things) is not very effective. Core aeration, which is admittedly more difficult and expensive, is what gets the best results, and is actually effective at controlling thatch.Here is one of the many pages on these subjects:[...]

review/summary: Good (albeit inconsistent) advice; your lawn will improve.
review/text: After reading through this book twice, highlighting various tips and tidbits, I realized that I couldn't put it all together into one organized plan. So I went through the book a third time, taking notes, and trying to categorize the author's advice. Guess what? It's not possible. This how-to book IS very disorganized, and worse, internally inconsistent. However, I concluded that if I just took a stab at using parts of his advice, formulas, when-to's, etc., that my lawn would probably improve. It did. No question. I like the fact that his methods are easy and inexpensive. I got much better results than I did with my previous 6x/year TrueGreen lawn service for $250. If you're interested in understanding what your lawn wants, this book has the advice if you're willing to sift through the disorganization.

review/summary: It might be easier to be green than you think!
review/text: I'm sure my fellow gardeners have noticed how a nicely tended strip of grass sets off a garden bed perfectly! Designers say our eyes need a place to rest before we can see all the beauty in front of us. Although most people make their New Years resolutions in December or January, I promise myself every July I am going to do something about my grass.....something other than dig it all up. We've all seen Jerry Baker on television spraying ammonia and dish soap all over his yard...I find it very intriguing. Jerry's book on lawn care has a ton of info to offer..and true enough it is a little hard to follow sometimes, but most people will not do everything anyway. For my poor lawn anything is an improvement, so if you are task-oriented, schedule based and really really care about your lawn this book should be very helpful. There are a lot of chemicals included in the regimen so beware if you like me avoid them. But there is a lot here that will be used on my own little patch of soon to be healthier grass. If you want more details, reviews of other gardening books or simple little garden musings.

review/summary: Has many helpful tips if not a systematic guide
review/text: This book is not a detailed lawn program for lawn care. It is more or less a collection of articles and tips on lawn care. I certainly found many useful tips and helpful advice as I read through the book. However, in reading it front to back you will find that Mr. Baker differs in some small details from one presentation to the next, but his overall conception of what goes into a good lawn remains quite consistent throughout.Mr. Baker offers several of his famous tonics that I look forward to trying. Some of the advice seems a tad dated - he talks about buying things from Brookstone that aren't offered on their website anymore and he doesn't mention his own website www.jerrybaker.com that does offer many of them and more.The book discusses different types of grass and weeds, but doesn't offer much in the way of pictures. There are books that do and I find the pictures of the weeds very helpful in identifying them. But this book does offer state-by-state help on certain things and resources you can tap to get more information - very helpful.This book is certainly worthy the price I paid for it and I like the tips I picked up. It isn't perfect, but deserves a place on your shelf.

review/text: The book gives good tips on lawn care, but must be one of the most disorganized writings I have ever seen. Information is provided in bits and pieces here and there, and is someitmes inconsistent. For example, the beer &amp; amonia tip is given on at least three occaisions, each time with different mixture ratios and &quot;optimal&quot; application dates. Chapter 11 makes a half-baked effort do give a summary of the most important points in one place, only to be followed by a Q&amp;A chapter the muddles the situation. If you have the patience and desire to sort out the mess I think that the book is well worth the price.

review/text: This is one of the best orchestral/classical soundtracks I've heard in quite a while. I place it right up there with my other recent favorite, &quot;Shakespeare in Love.&quot; One thing that makes this soundtrack stand out is the original opera material - written to sound like an opera written around the turn of the century (1900). The opera cuts, the opening credits theme, and the closing credits are in my opinion the outstanding cuts, although there are many other very interesting and beautiful selections. (including some classical rags that are very fun to listen to). Top notch album. I highly recommend it, and I've heard them all. (or most of them)

review/summary: Couragous
review/text: On his earlier recording "Gotstabe a Better Way", James Spaulding recorded a number of songs from his suite "Song of Courage". On "Song of Courage", Spaulding records the title track - a swinging number with a vaguely Middle-Eastern melody - with a sextet of rock-solid musicians. Tenor saxophonist Roland Alexander contributes "Cabu", "Judy", and "King" while trombonist and former James Brown musical director Tyrone Jefferson brings the calypso-sounding "Black Market" to the session. James Spaulding, a master composer in his own right, contributes two songs: the title track and "Uhuru Sasa" (Swahili for "Freedom Now"). The program is rounded out by the standards "Wee" (taken at a very brisk clip), Elmo Hope's "Minor Bertha" and "Autumn Leaves". As with any James Spaulding recording his alto sax is sharp and quick, his flute lyrical and melodic. Reviewing a James Spaulding recording is tough - there's nothing to complain about and all the words of praise get used up too quickly. Another recording worth searching for. Line up: James Spaulding - alto sax & flute; Roland Alexander - tenor sax; Tyrone Jefferson - trombone; Kenny Barron - piano; Ray Drummond - bass; Louis Hayes - drums.

review/summary: not just for theologists
review/text: What a wonderful book! As an interested layperson with no background in philosophy or ethics, I've been trying to answer the question "What, exactly, does it mean to live a moral (Christian) life?". While this clear and highly readable book isn't meant to give superficially pat answers of the Chicken-Soup-for-the-Soul genre, its thorough explaination and assessment of the dramatic changes of thought of one of the most influential Christian theologians of our time allowed me to understand why Roman Cathohlics currently believe what they (we) beieve and how they got there. This book, while not taking sides, gave me the background to think more productively and clearly about my question.

review/summary: Mask Maker
review/text: I saw this at a store and the cover is probably the best i've seen in a long time. However, you cannot judge a horror movie but it's cover. 9 out of 10 times the movie will suck. Mask Maker is about a couple who buy a home in the middle of nowhere. A long time ago the woman who lived there was accused of being a witch and was killed by the towns people and so was her baby. Her husband whoses face was horribly burned saw the entire event, I might have missed something. Anyways, the man unearths a stick in the graveyard behind there house and the man is resurrected. If you're a person who needs to see someone killed every ten minutes, then this movie is not for you. It's slow placed but the kills are well done. The killer looks like the new Leatherface without muscles. The ending was a typical slasher ending and I guess there will be another part made. I'd welcome a sequel since this did have potential.Overall, a good horror movie that was a little slow paced.

review/text: I watched this last night. And I don't remember enough of it to give it a indepth review. But it wasn't as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on. If you don't like your killer to be supernatural then don't bother with this. Its about a guy that comes back from the dead. His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place. The acting wasn't bad at all, and neither were the deaths. In fact it was kinda gory. But that doesn't make a great movie. The flashbacks were a little confusing as well. I wouldn't watch it again. But its far from the worst movie I've seen.

review/summary: Combination of a suspense and slasher movie that drags on too long. A low rate, not that scary "Poltergeist". I say C
review/text: What if your dream turned out to be a nightmare? After Jennifer's (Deloach) boyfriend Evan (Colletti) surprises her with a new house for her birthday strange things begin to happen. This is a hard movie to review. It is not that bad, but it drags, a lot. It's another haunted house because of something buried in the land movie that is not that bad, but it would have been a good "Fangoria Series" movie at an hour long, trying to stretch it out for an hour and a half really hurt the movie. If you are looking for a decent horror movie that is a cross between suspense and a slasher, this is a good choice. If you are looking for a very scary movie then I would go for something else. Not terrible, not great. I did like the ending though. I give it a C.Would I watch again? - I doubt it.

review/text: I initially bought the movie just because Stephen Colletti (who I'm in love with) was one of the leads...and I really didn't expect much from what looks to be a low-budget indie horror flick. But, I really did like it! The lead girl who plays Jennifer (Nikki DeLoach) is really good. I can't believe I've never seen her in anything before? Maybe I have, but I didn't know!?! It was cool to see the guy from Weekend at Bernie's (Terry Kiser)...he is a really good actor. Too bad he was dead the whole time in both movies I saw him in, lol. Anyways, this was a cool movie and I'm glad I got it!

review/text: This movie was fun to watch although it drags on a bit at times. I have to say that I was more impressed with the acting in this low budget horror flick than the majority of the cookie-cutter characters I'm used to seeing in horror movies. If you are looking for a movie full of blood and guts, this may not be your cup of tea. But, if you want to watch a fun movie with good acting and some decent scares, this is your kind of movie. Definitely worth the watch.

review/summary: Needed a Face Lift
review/text: This film seemed to have a bit of potential at first. It was obvious it was going to be a rehash of a lot of the old Leatherface clich&eacute;s, but Nikki DeLoach's good humor was infectious and the couple launching off on their new life in the isolated old house was likeable. So I was ready to overlook the townsfolk with secret knowledge of the house's dangerous past - the gathering of frolicsome young people at the house, ready to be picked off by the killer while they were in the act - and all the other formulaic plot elements that the "Scream" series does such a good job satirizing.But then things got really dreary. Leatherface, Michael Myers, and all the other killers in that tradition might have seemed almost superhuman in their ability to rebound. But the key word with them was "almost." They might be inexorable, but it was still possible, however remotely, that they could be representing real people. A viewer could justify the time spent watching these films with the "based on a true story" rationale. After all, Ed Gein was a real person who really did drape himself in human skin.But the killer in this film seems to rise from the dead. He emerges from a mishmash of supernatural shenanigans. So there's no way I could feel I might learn anything about the heart of true evil by watching this film. And so it lost me."Mask Maker" is well-photographed and has a few scary moments. But over all, it's a false-face.

review/summary: Entertaining Slasher with elements of Other Well known films
review/text: Mask Maker starts off with a flash back of something traumatic that happened years before in a barn next to the main house but we don't really learn about the real story until Jennifer and Evan move in to the house years later and Jennifer finds and reads a journal and as she reads it we go to more flash backs..Jennifer and Evan get the house,barn and 40 acres for 10.000 dollars and feel so fortunate that they got such an amazing deal and better yet the house is filled with pricey antiques ,they are about to find out nothing good comes cheap.There were so many similarities between this and Friday The 13th part 2 and the house looks just like the one from the remake of the Texas Chainsaw massacre.There is even a scene very reminiscent of the scene where Jason falls face first onto a machete in F-13th part 4.I liked it because the story was pretty cool and the killer lurks around very Jason Voorhees/Michael Myers style and is very creepy.His face at first is bandaged because of some kind of skin Condition he had as a child.The new owners invite two other couples for the weekend and one by one they go missing "of course" gotta love the slasher formula.As each is killed the killer takes the skin from their faces and puts it over his, very Leather Face -esque..The kills and effects were good and not over done,it's the kind of semi gore you would see in a Friday the 13th film nothing over the top,that's why it had an old school feel to me.I give it 3 and 1/2 stars and would watch it again.

The deaths were alright and the storyline was good enough. His masks were basically the faces of whoever he killed which is easy to get in general. Plus they do show the backdrop to who this killer is and why everything is happening, so it was fun to watch this C horror film but don't rush out to buy it.

review/text: Positives:None that I can think of. Really, I'm trying.Negatives:(1.) Cheap, e.g. starting with no subtitles or special features. Acting experience/filmography for the most part consists of shorts, TV videos which is typical of cheap and quick almost made for TV productions. Cheap costume store style face masks and usual cheap knife/hatchet effects stabbings.(2.) Not creative (you've seen this storyline so many times), time worn college students in a remote farm. The usual Native burial (never explained why) and the usual some sort of illicit child grows up to cause some bodily harm to some really dumb acting students. The usual towns folk have a secret about the previous occupant of the farm house which was, thinking she was a witch, they killed her with a Native spear (never explained why). One person survives, as usual, and we think the bad grown up child person is dead - but not really. Time for a cheap money making sequel.(3.) The face mask has been done before and is anatomically/physically impossible for a variety of reasons so it loses some credibility points there. Besides they were't even scary. Unlike the superior SAW they didn't even bother to show much other than one time pulling a rubber mask off of a person to make it look like it was real.

review/summary: MASK OF FAMILIARITY
review/text: MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion. A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty. Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy.MASK MAKER isn't the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn't tread new waters either. The cast performs on various levels of competence. WEEKEND AT BERNIE's Terry Kiser is an effective guilt-ridden buffoon. Treat Williams is ill-used in a cameo role. Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role. Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role, giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female. Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti (sic) is equally flaccid.An open-ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II---something we definitely don't need.

review/summary: Unmasked..................
review/text: Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers. I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films. The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history. A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late. Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights. This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried. Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.Even the title is a misnomer! Although the original title, Maskerade, isn't any better.And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres.

review/summary: A testament to horrors
review/text: This over-sized 255 page volume is based a November 1991 through October 1999 U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum exhibit on the experiences of Kovno Ghetto residents during World War II, as they secretly photographed and artistically recorded them.In addition, the volume contains many images of Ghetto work documents and other Nazi-issued papers, and even the luggage tags of Jews transported from Germany and Austria for murder at "Fort IX," a fortification built near Kovno specifically to murder Jews, which executions began on June 24, 25, and 27, 1941, following the Nazi invasion of Lithuania.On October 28, 1941, the Germans separated 30,000 Jews from the square in Kovno, those to the left survived at least temporarily, and those to the right, were immediately marked for brutalization and ultimate death. for the time being, 20,000 remained. Everyone left lost a family member, and mourning set upon the community.Needless to say, their lot was not easy, and most ultimately succumbed.This is a valuable testament to horrors suffered in the Holocaust by one community, horrors that were repeated in every other ghetto across Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Poland and so on.Heartbreaking.--Alyssa A.

review/text: This book was in my library's Genealogy section, and you're not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library. But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust.

review/summary: The BEST introduction to Chinese Medicine on the market.
review/text: My partner is a Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist and Herbalist. Her basic education took 5 years to complete. Five years later, she still takes many supplementary courses each year to continue her education. Most of her free time is spend with distance learning courses or reaching herbs. Chinese Medicine is vast and deep. A 5 year basic study is not nearly enough time to understand this medicine. In Chinese Medicine, they say even a lifetime is not long enough to understand this medicine. Thankfully for the lay person we have this book!I personally own 2 copies of this book. One I have at home, the other is in our Chinese Medicine office. Many of our patients have purchased their own copy of this book after reading our office copy.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best book that I have read to understand what my partner practices. I have read other books, likeThe Web That Has No Weaver : Understanding Chinese MedicineandBetween Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine, although highly recommended, these 2 books are much more technical and can be overwhelming at times (especially The Web 2nd edition). After reading The Complete Illustrated Guide, if you want to learn more then these other two books are worth a read. Far and away the best dietary book on Chinese Medicine is Bob Flaw'sThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicine. Also,The Book of Jook: Chinese Medicinal Porridges--A Healthy Alternative to the Typical Western Breakfastby Bob Flaws is a good helpful for breakfast food and as a total diet longevity practice (similar to Kitchari in Ayurveda).The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine provides a complete overview of all of the modalities included under the largre umbrella of Chinese Medicine. You'll learn about the medicine theory, diagnosis, energetic "anatomy", acupuncture, herbal medicine, diet, exercise, qi gong, tai chi, meditation, and lifestyle theory.The section on diet is lacking, in my opinion, however the author does state that information on diet could fill an entire book itself - which is definitely true. ReadThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicinefor proper Chinese Medicine dietary knowledge.The sections on Qi Gong and Tai Chi are great for a general book. You'll be taught a basic sequence in each. For additional learning, Mantak Chia's books and DVDs are some of the most complete spiritual-style Qi Gong practices practices. Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming has created some of the best martial arts style Qi Gong and Tai Chi books and DVDs.The theory and science sections make up the majority of this book, providing an excellent introduction with much knowledge and no fluff. Someone interesting in attending TCM school would greatly benefit by reading this book first. You'll understand what TCM is and have good preparation for the conceptual basis of Chinese Medicine.The entire book is filled with pictures to support the information. A picture is worth 1,000 words and many times it is only through pictures that proper understanding can be attained (like meridians, tongue diagnosis, etc). The book is very well organized with section titles and concise paragraphs with subtitles. It is clear that the authors spent much time and calculation to create this book.Personally, I can't think of anything missing from this book. Although I would have liked to see another 2-4 pages on dietary theory and practice, it is not strong enough of a complaint to remove a star from my rating. This book is 5 stars all the way!Additional note:It is important to remember that Chinese Medicine is a medicine and should only be practiced by a trained professional. There is a lot that a person can do to improve health and grow spiritually without the help of a Chinese Medicine practitioner/doctor - like diet, exercise, meditation, qi gong, yoga, etc. However when it comes to deeper knowledge and practices like Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine, these are best left to the professionals. My partner is a professional Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist and Herbalist. It is common that people come into her office who are worse off after having self-treated using herbal knowledge from books, magazines, and newscasts. Taking herbs for symptom relief is not anywhere close to the Chinese Medicine herbal understanding. If you are suffering from health problems, please see a professional.After it's complete, an education in Chinese Medicine is a 5 year Ph.D. program (including both Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine). This is an entire year longer than Western Medicine. This is not to say that Chinese Medicine is superior, but rather that both studies are long and difficult. Chinese Medicine should not be looked at to be inferior to modern Western medicine. Rather both are complete forms of medicine and require much more understanding than can be gained by a single text book.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best place to start to better understand what Chinese Medicine is and how you can live a healthier and happier life.Was my review helpful?

Also, if you have travelled the Caribbean as I have you; you will find that the author captures the essence of them and brings back vivid memories. The story covers many areas such as Romance, Mystery, Suspense, Action, and Adventure.

review/summary: Not as described
review/text: I like this pool for hermit crabs, but I received one that does not look like the picture and is smaller than described. My pool has the diving board and palm tree on the same side, not at opposite sides as shown. The dimensions of my pool are 5" H x 4.5" W x 7" L. The seller describes the size as 6.3 x 6.9 x 8.8 inches. I have medium sized hermies that are growing fast and I wanted a bigger pool for them, so I am disappointed that this pool is not as large as described. FYI: pool interior measures 4.5" L, 2.5" W at widest point. The depth is 3/4", so the small crabs may need some rocks on the bottom.

review/summary: pioneering ambient direction for Hillage
review/text: Released after 'green' in 1979, this album of what was then considered experimental electronic music, now called 'ambient', is a seminal document in the field. more joyous and uplifting, and more engaging principally than others experimenting in the field at the same time, these two performances contain beautiful and melodic synth textures over which Hillage provides some liquid guitar work. it would take 12 years before Hillage would pursue this direction again in system 7 and climb the electronic heights.

review/summary: intelligent ambient - deserves recognition
review/text: I was at the 'cosmic event' at Earls Court in '78 or '79 when this piece of music was recorded for playback in some kind of immersion tent with lots of moody lighting and a few cushions in the centre to fall on...stoned with aunty chemical, of course. I was nineteen and went there with my dad.Saying that, SH is one of the true expoents of ambient music - even more so than Brian Eno (who had not made ambient his own by that time). But I think Steve understood the inner spirit of ambient better than anyone - especilly the playful side: never taking it too seriously - he even fronted Deavadip John McLaughlin at the Hammersmith the same year for Christ sake.Buy this, enjoy the tinkling water, the tibetan finger symbols while reacing out ot smoke whatever comes to hand. It defined electronic soundscape before the likes of Steve Roach, Vir Unis, Vidna Obmana or Jon Jenkins had ever first twiddled a VC3 analogue knob.Pure cosmic bliss. May all your many gods bless you Steve Hillage.JB

review/summary: Lullabies from the Planet Gong
review/text: This is a whole album of mostly sweet, gentle, soothing and high toned new-age music ( I say mostly, because there are moments of creative dissonance). Recorded for the London Festival of Mind Body and Spirit which played in April of 1979, it is a very trippy, yet consistent recording - Hillage often on glissando guitar as well as that distinctive Gong (and Pink Floyd) delayed echo-rhythm, as well as keyboards, accompanied by Miquette Giraudy on keys, synth and Tibetan bells. That's it - no drums, bass or vocals. The effect is very soothing and high, slightly strange, but not over indulgent or boring, dull or slow (or melancholic as Eno often was).In fact, the first composition, "Garden of Paradise" is very active, energetic and even hyper in a meditative way - in other words, psychically busy (like a diverse garden in the process of doing it's thing), and I'm not sure I'd want to actually sit and "meditate" to it. For me this is perfect background accompaniment for doing things around the house - like cooking and cleaning or artistic activities, but its a bit too intense to read to or concentrate on something else with.The 'second side', "Four Ever Rainbow", is very much like an extended version of the lovely glissando suite on the second side of Daevid Allen's 1977 classicNow Is Happiest Time of Your Life(funny how their glissando playing sounds almost identical huh?). It is the more spacey and meditative composition here, good for relaxing or taking a little mind trip to.I remember around the time of this album there was a lot of electronic new-age ambient music in the air (a la Steve Halpern), but this has something different about it; more warm and human, not detached cosmic vibes, but something playful and intimate like from another inhabited water bearing planet, a planet we can just as well call Gong.

review/text: With all due respect to ambient music enthusiasts, I was really disappointed that there was no guitar work whatsoever on this album. Hillage fans of L and Fish Rising be forewarned.Steve Hillage was a pretty darn good guitarist. Maybe L was his showcase with members of Todd Rundgren's Utopia backing him up.Noting that other reviewers have rated this highly, I will give it another listen. However, I am dissapointed in the direction Steve has taken his music.

When you handle a good memory foam pillow, it feels heavy and cushy in your hands. This thing feels like a piece of hard styrofoam. It barely squishes at all and has no 'memory', it is simply a very dense foam pillow. It's not even really a pillow- It's so hard that I cant even use it for propping my back whilst reading.On top of that, their terrible return pollicies make it not worth returning.DO NOT BUY! Just use the styrofoam your new computer came in.Ugh.

review/summary: Will not be purchasing another one of these
review/text: It worked fine in the beginning. 2 months or so into using it its performance was up in the air. I would find myself sleeping with one hand under the pillow to give it some leverage; otherwise my neck would end up in an awkward position. At times it felt like I needed to have 2 pillows because it was lacking in width and was too soft. I had to also rotate what end and what side I would lay my head/neck on. It, therefore, did not provide the support I needed.

review/summary: Catchy and Great
review/text: I happened to stumble upon The Films last month and was very pleased when I heard this album. The album opener, "Good Day" sets an almost bouncy and upbeat tone for the album. The songs that come after follow in the same footsteps of direct and almost hilarious lyrics, very catchy hooks, and some infectious instrumentation. The vocalist is very aware of his range and use it perfectly over the various topics.The album doesn't seem to have many weak points, with each song giving off a different essence and sense of purpose. Highlights would nearly include the album's entirety. "Black Shoes", "Belt Loops", and "Body Bag" seem to be the three strongest songs on the album with the rest not far behind. Slow starts on a couple of tracks would be the only critique I could give. This album is very much so worth a purchase.

review/summary: Not Like the Old Formula
review/text: The formulation of this product has been changed since Artec was bought by L'Oreal. The new formula doesn't hold hair like the old Artec original formula did, and it doesn't smell as nice. Don't be fooled by this picture (12/29/07)--it is a pic of the old Artec bottle, but I ordered and received the new L'Oreal Professionel version, which is terrible. The original Artec version was similar to, but not as sticky as, Potion 9. I wish L'Oreal would go back to the old formula :( I emailed them to this effect and they never even replied. If anyone can recommend a similar product, please comment to this review.

review/text: My hair is pretty curly, and keeping it short will frizz like crazy. This smoothing serum is my favourite product for taming the fuzzy hair. Unlike other products it is not sticky when applied, and not sticky when I wash my hair the next morning. Any other smoothing product I've tried needs shampoo to get rid of, this will simply wash out with water.This has a very light fragrance, nothing obnoxious.

review/summary: finally, non prescription relief !!
review/text: After almost a decade on various medications to relieve my anxiety I was tired of relying on and paying for medications. I did research on GABA as a stress reliever and started taking it. First on an as needed basis, and now every day. GABA along with a B Complex vitamin have changed my life around, and for the first time in almost 10 years, I am off of prescription meds!! Back in October I spent 4 weeks out of state to take care of my dying father. Even though it was incredibly difficult and sad, I was able to keep it together without medication. GABA taken at night promotes a restful sleep and together with B Complex has given me a new found relaxation and peace.I do not recommend that anyone takes themselves off medication without their physicians ok - especially for severe depression or overwhelming anxiety. But I highly recommend that people experiencing excessive stress or anxiety issues give Kals GABA 750mg a try along with a quality B complex vitamin

review/summary: A profound if somewhat exaggerated analysis of 'global secularization'
review/text: How the world has changed since Harvey Cox argued that there is an inevitable and inexorable process of global secularization which is leading to a total separation of the political and religious. Cox's argument was that urbanization and secularization go together, and that they empty the world of mythic and traditional religious power.Today forty years after the publication of his book the world is in the midst of a global struggle in which the forces of Western democratic society are pitted against a radical Islamic revivalist fundamentalism. Moreover within the realms of other religions including Christianity there has been a kind of 'return to religion' which was certainly not dreamnt of in Cox analysis. He did not have a clue in regard to the Evangelical revival in the United States, and the prominent place it would come to play, ( Perhaps unprecedented place) in American politics.This does not make Cox's analysis wrong for his time. Nor was he mistaken in seeing the important trend to secularization. He only made the mistake most of us make of seeing the past and future of what seemed to him the predominant and irreversible trend of his time.But History and the development of Mankind have a way of surprising us all.As a footnote I would say that the one area of the world in which Cox analysis does seem to be largely correct today is Europe. 'Post-Christian Europe' however does not seem the apogee of human enlightentment , the wave of the future. Rather it seems more a declining island already invaded by those kind of 'religious forces it expelled as Christian and is receiving as Muslim'.Irony of ironies, that the very heart of the 'secular city' today seems as if it will in a matter of generations take a great fall into backwardness. But again this is an aside, and I would instead make the more general caveat, that no one should fall so readily into the underlying assumption of Cox's analysis i.e. that there is a predominant historical trend for the future which we can clearly discern.Wisdom and humility would suggest that we rely more on our powers of future observation than of extrapolation from the Past.

He was a warm &amp; caring man who loved his music and passed the feeling on to his audience. Another reviewer said she felt &quot;goosebumps&quot; when she heard his music again on the CD's, and I agree. The music world lost a great entertainer when Dick passed away, he sadly never achieved the star billing that he so greatly deserved.The way range of his voice was unreal The set of CD's was purchased as a surprise Christmas gift for my husband, but I couldn't wait that long to hear it. Beautiful music &amp; memories! We have nearly all of his original singles and albums but nothing can compare to this. Anyone hearing him for the first time will want to hear more.!!

Both box sets "Traveling Man" and "Tombstone Every Mile", cover the entire career recordings of Dick Curless.

review/text: I've been using this model racket for around 15 years and it's still one of the best rackets ever made by Prince. The Prince Graphite Mid Plus is still one of the stiffest rackets you can get and it also has excellence weight and balance.This racket is more suited to the higher standard player. It provides exceptional control especially with volleys. I have these rackets strung at between 62-64 pounds for hard court and grass court play.It will be a sad day when there are no more of these rackets available.

For years, I played with the OS version of this racquet which is noticeably more powerful and is a little more forgiving than the MS version. At this point, I prefer the MS version more just because of the better control and feel.Even now, the Prince Graphite (OS or MS) is still a great racquet, and IMO, one of the best control racquets ever made.

review/summary: Fantastic racquet / easy on the arm
review/text: After overdoing it, having shoulder surgery, and going through many months of physical therapy, I was finally ready to dive back into tennis. My original racquet was one of those 8oz extremely-light jobbies with the super-stiff string. It was great to volley with, but absolute murder on the arm! After a season using one of those, I had some odd issue with my hand, something called golfer's elbow, and then labrum issues in my shoulder. All the vibration and shock from striking the ball would transfer directly into my hand/elbow/shoulder and rattle me into surgery.Back to this racquet. It was recommended to me by many folks and I figured I would give it a shot. I have been using it for a little over a year now. No arm pain at all anymore! I string it around 60lbs with Prince ProBlend and use a dampener. It does a great job on groundstrokes and gives you plenty of pace on the ball. This being a heavier racquet than my last, I figured my volleys would suffer. However, the Prince Graphite is slightly head-light and makes it easier to maneuver for volleying.All-in-all, I highly recommend it and plan on getting another 1-2 once I finally get a job again!

review/text: My daughter wanted this for a few months before I finally gave in and bought it for her. She was so excited. We got home and played it for one hour hoping that something different or better would happen. The game was so so boring. You get to choose music, outfits, and which of the three skaters to skate. That is IT. Everything else is controlled automatically by the game. Barbie does everything perfectly whether you do or not. My daughter hasn't played it since and is so disapointed in it. The store I bought it from won't let me return it because it has been opened. They will let me exchange it for the exact same game but hello that is the problem.

review/summary: Eh. Save your money.
review/text: My daughter (almost four) begged for this game all holiday season. It was the sweetest thing, because she shyly told Santa this is what she wanted, and told people all December that Santa would bring it for her. Well, he did, and his reputation is tarnished in our house now!She was bored with it the first time she played with it. Your child's interaction consists of choosing which girl of three to skate (fun), choosing which outfit of five to wear (fun) and pressing the up or down arrow to make Barbie skate faster or slower to do the jumps (zzzz). Not by your own choice, you move the arrow to match the color of the line on the ice.Freestyle mode wasn't much better--go 'round and 'round in circles. There may be more to it but who cares at this point?My own personal mommy beef: Barbie never falls. Barbie either does the jump perfectly or doesn't do it at all. I figured they could put a little extra effort into the design and give the kids the all important (even if subliminal) message that it's okay to not be perfect, and that it's NORMAL to fall, or fail as the case may be. But again, it's Barbie, the perfect girl with the unattainable proportions, so what can you expect? :)

review/summary: Bad skating technique
review/text: I didn't buy this game, becuase I can tell by the pictures that Barbie has very bad skating technique (see below). This game is not for kids who want to have fun while seeing a good skating program.Pictures on Amazon1) Box picture -- I can't tell whether or not Barbie is stroking or doing a bad spiral? Either her leg is too high if she is stroking, or her body and leg are not in the right position if she is doing a spiral.2) Layback -- Although it's hard to see, it looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick.3) Split jump -- Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump. She is also not kicking her boots up.Pictures on vugames (makers of the game)1) Stroking -- Barbie's body is crooked. She doesn't have her weight over her stroking leg, and her body is leaning to the side. I've never seen anyone stroke like this.

review/summary: A Fantastic Game
review/text: My little sister and I got this for Christmas. I wasn't so sure about it at first, 'cause Barbie's for lil' kids, but once I started playing I couldn't stop. The way it works is that you first choose a routine, girl to perform, and your skating style. (Easy, medium, or expert) After you have practiced, you choose her outfit, music, ice color, decorations, etc. Then you get to skate your show. There are five stops on the tour, finishing with a secret, mysterious, magical ice rink. You'll find out what it is when you get there! After you finish the tour, you get to put on exhibition shows, where you can choose from all the costumes, routines, music, locations- everything from the previous tours. Let me tell you, I am a competitive gymnast, not a figure skater, and this game still is one of my favorite computer games. It will appeal to everyone.

review/text: My 7 year old got this for her birthday recently. She wanted this really bad and I thought I wouldn't be able to get her off the computer once she started. She's only played it about 4 or 5 times in the last month. She enjoys it when she's playing but once you've put on a show, there's not any challenge left. Not the worst computer game we've bought but it could have been far better!!

review/summary: Barbie's Sparkling ice show is fun!
review/text: Barbie sparkling ice show is really cool. First,You're on a 'sparkling ice tour' you get 3 skaters:Barbie,Teresa, and Christie. And then you choose a routine and a skater.Second,you do a ''practice routine''(as far as I can remember)in which you(what else?)practice your routine.There's a little meter next to Barbie(whichever skater you choose) ,you have to match the color on the meter to the color of the path,vice versa.And then, you do your show with clothes,music,etc.Then you do your show and when you're done move on to other places.(my favorite is in the sky).You keep doin' this until you reach the end and then you can do an exebition show (if that's how to spell it).And either you keep doin' exebition shows or else sign-in with a different name.The two complants I have is that the game should have more skaters and places.Also,I can only do the tour once unless I sign-in with a different name. I have this game on my computer and it works wonderfully,no bugs. For me, the graphics are beutiful and it feels like I'm there with Barbie! Oh,and I wish,at the end of the show,they(it) could throw the roses at Barbie in a more realistic motion.:) I mean,in my view,it looks like they are opening two invisible crates of roses next to Barbie and the roses all''gush''out at Barbie's feet! :D Over all,Great and Highly Recommended! I play it for hours on end! (: 'BARBIE LOVER' :)

review/text: My daughter received this cd for Christmas. It is very slow loading lots of wait time for things to happen. When she finally chose the skater and where she should skate (only one choice worked), my daughter kept asking what she could do now. Most of the time we were watching Barbie skate beautifully. Not very interactive. I consider this a waste of space on my computer, a waste of time for us to use. I would recommend saving your money and get something worthwhile.

review/summary: Pretty Disappointing
review/text: In the words of my 6 year old niece: "This is Really Boring (sigh)".Does being able to choose the color of the ice and Barbie's outfit compensate for what is a fairly limited program with mediocre (at best) graphics? In the eyes of that young Barbie devotee, obviously not.To make matters worse, the game's producers apparently decided to create a "multilingual" product by relying on icons without any text for most operations. This approach often makes it quite hard to determine what each does without the manual.Can't you just discover the actions of different buttons you wonder? Well, the game designers often chose to not provide any feedback that something was happening that may take a while. No hourglass, no clock, no spinning skater cursor. So for those operations that take more than a few seconds (e.g. loading a new scene) the player ends up thinking their click did nothing and they try clicking something else with unpredictable results. Frustrating.A final word about the graphics. Sure you can dress her and her friends in five different outfits, but shouldn't we expect something a little more than 640x480 resolution these days?It didn't crash, but you should save your money. If you could skate Barbie into a wall it MIGHT have been worth it. After 45 minutes with this program, that is what BOTH of us wanted to do.

review/text: I bought this game because I am a figure skating fan and found the Barbie Gymnastics to be well done, so I thought that this would be too. It was an absolute waste of money. The graphics are awful and the game play is far too simplistic. There is nothing to strive for in the game and it is too easy to pass onto the next level. I can't imagine a child above the age of 3 or 4 getting any enjoyment from this game.

review/summary: Not just for little kids!
review/text: "Barbie Sparkling Ice Show" is a fabolous game and can really inspire creativity and imagination, and that's coming from someone whose 13 years old! This game allows you to pick routines, music, costumes, and fun stuff like decorations and ice color and put it all together to make fabolous routines for Barbie, Christie, and Teresa on the five stops of the Sparkling Ice Tour. But once you finish the tour, the fun doesn't end there- you can continue on skaiting cool exhibition shows using all of the details of previous shows.To work the game, you start off by preparing for the first stop of the tour and practice a routine that you pick out of a few selections with the skater you have chosen. You can pick from three levels: easy, intermediate, or hard, and each one provides more challenges than the next. If you skate the routine well and do a good job, you will be able to do all the "good stuff"- choosing your music, costume, decorations, etc. for the tour. The game continues on like this for different tour stops such as Rose Garden and Island Paradise, with your goal to make it to the secret surprise location where you can even create your own routine.I found this game to be a lot of fun and not at all boring. Granted, it may be a little bit too easy to get through all the tour stops, but the fun doesn't stop since you can create a user name and start all over again or continue doing skating exhibitions. It is a fabolous game for all figure-skating and Barbie fans, not to mention that it is so much fun! Anyone ages 5 and up will enjoy this wonderful game.

review/text: I bought this game for my daughter who is almost seven. She enjoys it very much. It works perfectly with Windows XP. I like the fact that it has skill levels, which helps avoid the "frustration factor", which I'm sure most of you reading this have experienced. The only reason that I did not give it a "5" is because it is quick to complete, especially on the "easy" and "medium" levels. Unless your child is totally into figure skating or Barbie, I feel this game is not for the 8+ crowd.

review/text: My daughter, almost 7, loves this game. She got it a few weeks ago and still plays with it every day. We did have to upgrade our system, but the game hasn't crashed since and hasn't been slow. Despite what others have said this game has lots of levels and takes lots of practice to master the freestyle levels. (The skaters will do lots of different tricks once the user learns how to do them.) This game has even seemed to help my daughter's actual skating - she just went yesterday for the first time since receiving the game and had lots more confidence and moved more smoothly than she did the other times she went.

This is not a rating of this video (I didn't bother watching it) but just of the fact that there's absolutely no information in the Amazon product details which could have told me this wasn't the feature film I was looking for before I ordered it.

Llull, who is known as a missionary, poet, novelist, mystic, philosopher, father and husband, and even perhaps an alchemist, strongly connects tribulation-suffering with the greater experience of God's love. A challenging message.

review/summary: The Gathering hands out their bag of goodies for Halloween this past year
review/text: Accessories: Rarities & B-Sides(2005). A double disc collection of unreleased B-sides, cover songs, and alternate outtakes of previously released songs.I still remember picking up Mandylion(1995) two years ago and having it just absolutely floor me with its ethereal atmosphere, non-typical doom pace approach, and of course miss Anneke Van-Giersburgen's deliciously lovely vocals. It was a proto-goth metal album in the sense that they found a sound that many other bands have tried to copy and perfect since its release, long after The Gathering decided to progress into other areas. I can see them appealing to the goth crowd for its different shades of melancholy found in their style. The metalheads out there can also be drawn to Mandylion because of its heavier guitar-oriented approach. Then I bought Nighttime Birds(1997), which continued Mandylion's heavier sound, though while not as hard-hitting as Mandylion was, NB still delivered the goods quite nicely. I've slowly started collecting their other material lately, but my interest in getting everything they've released didn't peak until I recently picked up this collection.Because it's been a few years since Souvenirs(2003), and also to tide people over until the new album Home(2006) arrives, Accessories offers the biggest fans of the band a ton of its unreleased (and released on singles) material, all crunched into a nicely packaged two discs, covering pretty much everything from their 1995-2000 era.So what do we have exactly? For starters, disc one is sprinkled with several live versions of some Mandylion tracks, a couple of them performed with a small orchestra backing them. They make for some interesting takes on those particular songs. And of course there are a couple other live takes like 'Amity' off of If_Then_Else(2000) and 'Frail' from How to Measure A Planet(1999). 'Adrenaline' is a Mandylion B-side that got cut from the album because they wanted to maintain a constantly slow doomy pace, and this particular song is much more upbeat and foot-tapping. They still played it live though to make for a nice change of pace. Other reviewers have already stated this, but I'd also like to contribute to the fact that the Slowdrive and Dead Can Dance covers are both phenomenal. I'm usually not so hot on cover songs because they're always a hit-or-miss deal, but in this case The Gathering score big time. The Talk Talk cover is also a decent cover taken from the If_Then_Else sessions. Definitely a prime reason for anyone to consider buying this collection, if not for all the other stuff. 'Theme from The Cyclist' was an outtake written specifically for the short movie in the name.The rest of the songs on disc one, and taking up all of disc two are alternate outtakes of many of the tracks found on both NB and HTMAP. 'Third Chance' is one of their best faster songs, and this alternate outtake smokes the other one found on NB out of the water. 'Diamond Box' and 'Hjelmar's' are both previously unreleased instrumentals that offer an interesting listen. I still have yet to hear the HTMAP album, so I can't really appreciate its alternate outtakes yet, but I'll make it a priority to find it. I won't go into detail about the differences between the NB song versions, but I will say that if you're a big fan of both NB and HTMAP, these tracks will provide a good look at what the band had to work with.So is Accessories absolutely a mandatory addition to a new fan's growing collection? Not really, but is it still worth buying? You bet! I'm giving it an easy five stars because of the wide variety of material presented here, plus it succeeded in getting me to want to run out and buy their other releases. It resurged my keen interest, and cemented the fact that The Gathering are definitely within my top 10 favorite bands of all time, and certainly head of the pack when it comes to goth rock type of music. What pushes this band way ahead of its contemporaries is not just in Anneke's lovely voice, and not just because they are outstanding songwriters, but really it's the fact that The Gathering is never content to stay the same. By focusing on delivering unique atmosphere, their music gets them into their special "zone" of lofty heights that not Lacuna Coil, Evanescence, Theatre Of Tragedy, or even Within Temptation can ever seem to reach. (Of course, these bands have their own takes on the gothic rock style, but I'm just a bit more biased toward the Gathering!) They're always looking for new and challenging ways to push the envelope in their music, and so they only seem to be getting better with age. Not to say that Mandylion and NB are lesser than their newer stuff because those albums still absolutely rule, but in effect, each subsequent release succeeds the previous one and gives the discerning fan something new and exciting to chew on. Accessories is a testament showcase to this ability to evolve over time, and perhaps there is no easier way to view this process than with both Accessories and the semi-accoustic live performance Sleepy Buildings(2004). Buy the other albums first, and then pick up this collection. RECOMMENDED TO BIGGER FANS.Other suggestions:-Any other Gathering album with Anneke on vocals: 'Mandylion'(1995), 'Nighttime Birds'(1997), 'How To Measure A Planet?'(1999), 'If_Then_Else'(2000), 'Souvenirs'(2003), and 'Home'(2006).-'Mother Earth'(2000) by Within Temptation-'In A Reverie'(1998) and 'Unleashed Memories' by Lacuna Coil.

review/summary: And again, The Gathering amazes me
review/text: The Gathering, to me, has always been an escape from the everyday music you hear. So when I heard they were releasing a B-sides and rarities collection I was more than happy. Every expectation I had, they met. I'm dumbfounded as to how The Gathering can create such innovative and beautiful music, yet they're still somehow overlooked. From the epic orchestrations to Anneke's jawdropping voice, there's no reason that everyone shouldn't love this music. Needless to say, if you liked The Gathering before you got this CD, if anything you'll like them more coming out of listening to it.Disc one acts as the B-sides. A lot of B-sides have horrible sound quality but the ones on this compilation sound as if they were on a CD but were taken off at the extreme last minute. There's a polished feel but not so polished that the music feels fabricated. The live versions featured on here are astounding. If you didn't look at the back cover to know they were live, you'd never guess it. Anneke's voice is gorgeous and the band is just simply amazing. How they don't miss a single beat I'll never know. The covers, Dead Can Dance's In Power We Entrust The Love Advocated, Slowdive's When The Sun Hits, and Talk Talk's Life's What You Make It are about the best covers I've ever heard. Quite often you hear a band just desecrate the original but with The Gathering, it feels like they took they're time while doing the originals justice.Disc two serves as the rarities section. From the opening track, New Moon, Different Day, you know that The Gathering is eons better than almost any band playing music today. Anneke's vocals simply soar and will give you goosebumps, that I will guarantee. It doesn't end there though, each song is equally as good as the last. Even the demos have a sound quality that could rival a studio CD. The two previously unreleased instrumentals, Diamond Box and Hjelmar's stand true to the ones that are released. The beauty is palpable and shows tremendous skill, skill that no radio band will ever come close to. Travel from the CD How To Measure A Planet? has always been my favorite song by The Gathering. To hear the demo is really something though, it sounds completely different while still sounding exactly the same. My second favorite track of their's, Nighttime Birds, is the same case as Travel. I do think Anneke's vocals are stronger on Nighttime Birds though.Overall my favorite songs are In Power We Entrust The Love Advocated, Frail, Life's What You Make It, New Moon Different Day, Nighttime Birds, and Travel. The Gathering is a band I've always found to be one that you have to experience rather than listen to. Yes, you can pick favorite songs but overall, each CD they released, and even this collection, seem to be made to go together. Each song seems to flow into the next seamlessly. In my opinion, no band does this genre more justice than The Gathering does.

review/summary: haunting and beautiful
review/text: All fans of The Gathering need to check this out, especially those in the States where the majority of these songs are nearly impossible to find anywhere else. This compilation is worth buying for "In Power We Entrust the Love Advocated" (Dead Can Dance cover) and "When the Sun Hits" (Slowdive cover) alone; both are heartbreakingly beautiful and feature some of Anneke's finest vocals.Fans of The Gathering's albums Mandylion and Nighttime Birds will be delighted with "Adrenaline," a very catchy song that was written because the band needed another fast, simple, rocking song to play at concerts.I think The Gathering's greatest album is How to Measure a Planet, and it is awesome to finally hear the demos for songs like "Travel," "My Electricity," and "Red is a Slow Colour." "Travel" especially went through a lot of transformations before its final version.This double-CD has so much to offer. There are also detailed song descriptions written by the band and several photos on the inside booklet.

review/text: If I could only have one selection by The Gathering, this would be it. Some of the alternate versions are better than what was originally released (e.g. instrumental version of Kevin's Telescope). This is a good introduction to the Gathering but it may set your expectations too high for the other releases. This is inventive progressive rock with an excellent female vocalist. My only reservation is the lyrical content which is weak at times.

review/summary: The Gathering....One of the most Underrated Bands ever!
review/text: Although the year 2005 was one in which we did not receive a new studio album from The Gathering, it is more than likely that the band and fans will still look back on this past season as a successful one. Not only did they release the live double DVD A Sound Relief which was certainly of a high quality, but also this double disc Accessories of rare and live tracks. While it is pretty easy to say that anyone vaguely familiar with The Gathering (and I assume that is practically everyone by now) will absolutely enjoy this record, it is also safe to assume that true fans will love it tenfold because it is a disc that appears to be especially for the fans. Practically spanning their entire career, there are in total 27 tracks on this album, the majority of which are demo outtakes, alternate versions, or live recordings. And while the majority of this material may not be earth shatteringly new, fans will still give their stamp of approval because it bears all the qualities you would come to expect from these Dutch masters.Breaking it down now, the first disc focuses on the B-sides released throughout the band's career. Here you will find many live gems including "In Motion" and "Leaves" versions which were the first live recordings with Anneke van Giersbergen after the recordings of Mandylion. You also have a nice live version of "Strange Machines" and yet another live version of "Leaves" both of these with full orchestra. The band also shows some of their roots with a couple of cover songs. For my money I found that the cover of Dead Can Dance "In Power We Entrust The Love Advocated" alone practically makes this disc worth the price of admission. Here we see a perfect example that epitomizes every thing that makes this band so great. Anneke's voice is angelic amongst a beautifully haunting atmosphere, creating something both memorable and emotional. Other noteworthy tracks include alternate versions of "Shrink" and "Third Chance" from "Nighttime Birds" sessions.Disc 2 now is the rarities and can actually be broken down into two different sections. The first is from the "Nighttime Bird" sessions and the second from "How to Measure A Planet" Anyone who has listened to these albums before will recognize alternate versions of classic songs (some quite more different than others) What I found interesting here are some unreleased instrumentals "Diamond Box" and "Hjelmar's" along with an instrumental version of "Kevin's Telescope". As a whole, the second disc may lose a little momentum coming off the first, but with such a large quantity of material there is hardly anything to complain about. The packaging is also first class with some great photos and information on the majority of the tracks. In conclusion, I am certain that fans of The Gathering already possess this record, and I would recommend this collection to anyone who is remotely interested in their music. - Joe Grammatico

review/summary: Australia's best-kept secret is an absolute treasure!
review/text: Tex Perkins(of Beasts Of Bourbon/The Cruel Sea/Tex, Don &amp; Charlie fame) follows up his debut solo release, Far Be It From Me, with an even better effort on Dark Horses. The bonus disc is an absolute must for Tex fans. It features Charlie Owens on guitar. Tracks 1-5 were recorded live in Sydney on 2/9/00. The first song is Can't Say No(originally app. on Beasts Of Bourbon-The Low Road). The next two are from Far Be It From(This Is Forever &amp; Her Own Life). Tracks 4 &amp; 5 are from the Tex Don &amp; Charlie era(songs: What I Done To Her &amp; Still The Same). The sixth and final bonus track is Splendid Lie(recorded live-10/23/00). These are smooth quality live recordings, not the usual noisy garbage throw-aways you sometimes find on bonus discs.The actual Dark Horses CD is a mellow collections of beautiful, realistic realtionship tales featuring guitars(Charlie Owens), electric piano, drums, cello, sandpaper, bass, tambouroine, organ, glockenspiel, violin &amp; lap steel. Highlights include I Know Y'Know, Please Break Me Gently &amp; the standout track- Blissfully Blind. There's also a hidden track...a differnt version of She Speaks A Different Language. Tex has never been more soulful than he is on Dark Horses. He may not be a Bob Dylan lyrically, but he is well above adequate as a songwriter. Produced by Tony Cohen. Cohen has produced many albums for Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds + Beasts Of Bourbon. Find out why Tex Perkins is a famous musical figure in Australia. This is an amazing release without the bonus CD. It can only be enhanced by the inclusion of an extra CD that would have been an excellent EP on its own merits. Enjoy!The picture next to the title at the top of this page is not correct. That is not Tex. This cover looks like the regular Dark Horses release. The differnce is that this one is a foldout digi-pack with room for the bonus CD.

review/text: Tex Perkins finds a groove in this mellow acoustic album which displays his vocal talents very well. The once lead singer for The Cruel Sea, Tex is well known by many Australian listeners. New listeners will appreciate his blue style and deep raspy voice, along with some good guitar work. Although his success has been confined to Australia so far, hopefully more will come to know the sound of Tex Perkins. His mood goes well with Jeff Buckley's &quot;Grace&quot; as well as Fiona Apple.

review/summary: Dark Horses a must have CD
review/text: I have had this album on my 'must buy' cd list for some time and I finally got around to making the purchase in 2004. All I can say is that I should have purchased it earlier.A wash of alternative-rock-country-blues etched with dark and somber imagery. However it's not melancholic, just quietly introspective and laid-back.Works very well with a cup of coffee/tea, a newspaper and a lazy Sunday afternoon.

Use them in my office where the triple handles the three lamps, and in the house where three singles are with three different lamps in the bedroom, home office and basement. Makes it nice to turn all the lights on from one place (my desk in the office) or from the door so you don't have to walk into a dark room and grope for the lamp switch. Used daily for about 6 weeks and going strong. I've had others in the past and they have lasted years and years. These are nicely made and seem durable. Mounting is a good idea so you don't end up groping for the remote in the dark!

review/text: I bought the 3 pack that comes with a single remote (very convenient). I've rated it down a bit because while this product works well with lamps and fans that have knobs that you turn, it only half works with fans or other products that turn on with buttons. For example, I have a fan that you press the button three times to go from low to high to off. The remote will turn it off, but won't turn it back on. Same thing with a button-only air conditioner. Since I bought it to use with two items that have buttons, I was disappointed it wouldn't turn those back on. However, it does turn my twist-dial fan both on and off.

review/summary: 80's synth-rock for......the thinking man. (And woman. And child.)
review/text: It started for me in the latter years of the 70's when I and a few select friends of mine were discovering the treasure troves of virtually unheard-of music that was European progressive music (unheard-of in the sheltered confines of the central United States, anyway). Having heard the name of Rupert Hine as producer--and liking his work--it was doubly-intriguing to see his name come up as the frontman & vocalist/keyboardist of a little band called QUANTUM JUMP, of whom some of you truly fortunate ones might be familiar. If for whatever reason you who are reading this choose to read no further and opt to check out QJ, by all means, do so now. Their uniqueness, precision as musicans, and their love of the weird and the absurd and the humorous in music set them far, far apart from their league of contemporaries. The JEM import records catalog, in a semi-successful attempt to describe them, said something to the effect of, "Imagine a cross between Frank Zappa and Steely Dan." Not TOO far off the mark, yet falling painfully short of describing how utterly wonderful their music was. So: go check them out, faithful readers, and then come back here.Fast-forward to 1986, the heyday of the MTV era, and the debut of Thinkman's first album/cassette, THE FORMULA...and its winning, very catchy and even very danceable hit, "Best Adventures." Loved the video, loved the song, ran out and bought the cassette, loved it to death, played it to death......and here I am, 21 years later, rediscovering Thinkman and preparing to order it on CD. It COULD be a fair speculation that this could be what Quantum Jump might have sounded like, had they stayed together for more than 2 fantastic albums (QUANTUM JUMP and BARRACUDA), & yet Thinkman does indeed claim a place of its own. Rupert shares vocals with at least one other member of the band (I wish I could say who, but there were very few liner notes with the cassette), and continues his songwriting partnership from his QJ days with Jeannette Obstoj. The music is energetic as all get-out, the vocals varying between manic, calmly enthusiastic and pensive, and a good share of the 8 songs have to do with urging the whole of humanity to THINK, MAN! :o) One thing I love about some of these tracks (and, incidentally, there's not a dud on the entire release, IMHO) is their praise of all of us as a race of beings capable of rising to the levels only attained (so far) by the likes of Einstein, particularly "Legend," "The Ecstasy of Free Thought," and the indescribably inspiring closing track, "There Shines Our Promised Land." Those titles alone should serve to inspire, wouldn't you say?As with Quantum Jump, it's regrettable that this fine amalgam of musicians had a short life span, but what they gave us in this release is a collection of tracks that not only is a showcase of what was truly good about the music of the 80's, but also a glowing, loving offering to all music lovers that, I believe, was intended to gently remind us of what we are capable of achieving in our lifetimes, if only we would. Look deeply into, enjoy, and even DANCE to the great, great music of Thinkman.

review/text: Just want to say that this is one of my all-time favorites. Still sounds as good today as it did back in 1986. Still relevent and uplifting. Rupert Hines solo recordings are also excellent as well as his production work with the Fixx and others. I really miss this guy. He was so overlooked, having created some of the very best music of the 80s and of all time.

review/summary: one of the best night world books!!!!
review/text: first of all i thought that this was one of lj smith's best books she has written adn also the funniest. i love all the characters but my fave one in the book is Ash. he's really a hottie and a babe i just love him 4 trying 2 be real. so far ash and thierry are my 2 most fave male characters in the night world series. anyways this book is about 3 sisters who are fugitives from the night world trying to live normal lives with humans but finding out that theyre brother Ash wants them back home. and meets up with mary- lynnette who turns out to be his soulmate but doesnt want it as much as she doesnt want it either. anyways i thought Ash was a much better character in daughters of darkness than in secret vampire i thought he acted like a jerk in the 1st night wortld book. it tells me that he has gotten better and that not all humans are bad to live by. i would love to have a guy like Ash for a bf. he's a total babe. funny 2. well g2g also if anyone is waiting for strange fate 2 come out it wont be coming out til 2004.

Their brother finds out where they are and tries to drag them back, except for a few minor details he has it all figured out. 1. someone else knows where the girls are and if Ash doesn't bring them back, Quinn will bring in the authorities. 2. Ash has found his soulmate Mary-Lynette who also knows their secret identity. 3. someone killed their aunt and they don't know who, is it a vampire hunter or someone who knows the truth.The vampires are in danger and Ash and Mary-Lynette have fallen in love.

review/summary: Disappointing to say the least
review/text: This book is probably, in my opinion, one of (if not THE) worst in the Night World Series. It is Ash's story this time, who's soulmate just happens to be a human. (which Ironically was shadowed upon in the first book, 'Secret Vampire'.) Ash's character was cool, charismatic....and totally wasted in this book. Mary Lynnette was too self riteous, too...I don't know. To me, she didn't come off as the strong female lead she was supposed to. Instead, I found myself annoyed at her several times throughout the book. She was presumptuous, she was always assuming things, and she was rather stereotypic if you ask me. I think someone like Maggy from 'Black Dawn', or even someone like Hanna or Gillian from 'Soulmate' and 'Dark Angel' would have been a better match for Ash, not this smart alec, holier than thou woman named Mary Lynnette.The book itself was lacking as well. We pretty much learn nothing about the nightworld, it doesn't much progress the series except to mention a few characters that appear in future books. All in all, a disappointment. Ash's first appearance in 'Secret Vampire' stole the show, so when this book was released, I was ecstatic. 'Finally', I thought. 'Something that touches on Ash's past and personality. We will finally get to read his story.' Well, as it turned out, he was poorly underwritten. Or perhaps this particular book would have worked better if it had been a little later in the series, if Mary Lynnette wasn't so sharp tongued, if there weren't so many CHARACTERS to concentrate on. This wasn't so much Ash and M.L's story as it was all the sisters. Too many people to concentrate on. The three sisters should have been given their own book for character developement if that was the case. I would suggest this book only to those who wish to further their Night World series collection, or just their L.J Smith collection, in general. As for the enjoyment factor?...Nadda.

review/summary: Excellent Book!!!!!!
review/text: The plot, setting, mood and atmosphere in Daughters of Darkness was very potential. Ms. Smith developed the characters very well. The only improvement for this book should be the style and wording of the text. Even though L.J. Smith describes her characters well, she tends to repeat things more than necessary. It is good to remind the readers what a charater looks and acts like, but it seems that every other page she repeated the same thing or switched the characters in the content like she could not think of anything else to say.

review/summary: The Best of the Night World
review/text: Though the plot is much like that of Pride and Prejudice, this book has a real feeling and flow that the rest of the Night World books can't compare with. There is a depth of character in both Mary-Lynnette, Ash, his sisters and Mark that L.J. Smith can usually only spin in the three books of her earlier trilogies. The departure of Ash at the end of the book has left me, now more than a year later, still anticipating his return, and the furthering of the relationship between him and Mary-Lynnette. The characters seemed more down-to-earth and more easy to identify with, as the author didn't go into the somewhat fascinating but still pointless and shallow descriptions of every physical characteristic of the characters. Mary-Lynnette seemed a truly real girl, with dreams of her career in astronomy and her share of problems. Ash, although made a spectacle of with his good looks in the first novel of the Night World, was intelligent and portrayed well. I wish that Ms. Smith had chosen to chronicle this book into an entire trilogy as she has in the past; I would have found Mary-Lynnette and Ash even more enthralling if we had seen their development over the course of a longer period.

review/text: I have read just about everything L.J. Smith has ever written. It all started when a friend of mine gave me The Strange Power- Vol. 1 of my favorate L.J. trilogy entitled Dark Visions and I loved it! I read everything I could get my hands on by her!! Before I discovered these books I never read anything due to sheer boredom. Now I feel that these books have helped me immensly! Anyway, I really should get on to my comments concerning the book. Daughters Of Darkness is really one of the best Night World books of all. It is sweet, suspenseful, and well written all in one great package. Unfortunetly, though these book literally melt my heart, I am afriad I will never find a man worthy of my all time favorate L.J. Smith badboys such as Ash(Daughters of Darkness), Gabriel(mmm.. oh! um Dark Visions), Nick(Secret Circle), and Quinn(short but sweet... from The Chosen). Oh well!! Anyhow read the books, people!! Then you'll know what I'm talking about!! OK!!???

Mary-Lynnette and Ash are so realistic, besides that he's a vampire. My favorite part is when Mare keeps kicking him in the shins. It's funny, because it also tells us (this is what I interpreted) that it doesn't matter what race you are, it matters whats on the inside. Afterall, like Jade says, &quot;You can't be soulmates with vermin!&quot

review/summary: Second Book in the Night World Series
review/text: Set in Briar Creek, Oregon, "Daughters of Darkness" primarily follows 17-year-old Mary-Lynnette Carter, though the book is supposedly about her new neighbors, three vampire sisters: Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade Redfern. The book does start off that way, following these three runaways on their way to their aunt's house. There they discover that their aunt has been killed--staked through the heart by a possible vampire hunter who wants to punish them for breaking the laws of the Night World, which all vampires, werewolves, and witches must abide by in this series. In an attempt to cover their tracks, the sisters bury the old woman in their backyard, but Mary-Lynnette sees them doing this--and again, later on, in the company of her younger brother, Mark, when they transfer the body into the woods.To make a long story short, Mary-Lynnette and Mark are befriended by these vampires in a blood-tie ceremony and promise to help find the killer running loose in Briar Creek. Like all of L. J. Smith's books, there's an added bit of romance to the paranormal/horror base of the story, for both Mary-Lynnette and Mark. (They meet their respective soulmates: Ash and Jade.) Even though I haven't read any of the other books in this series and can't compare this one to the others, I really liked "Daughters of Darkness." It was fast-paced, well-written, and ideal for teens who are into paranormal romances.

review/summary: This book had me giggling
review/text: I'm sorry, but I just find the way Mary Lennette treats Ash to be just hillarious. Mary Lennette is like a Nancy Drew. Ok, actually I never liked the Nancy Drew series and never read them, but the book kind of starts out with a mystery like that. She's just a character who if Iknew her in person, I'd probably like her. She's smart, and stands pretty much up for what she believes in and really does care for people. She's just totally not the person I could ever picture Ash with. I still can giggle at that part where she realizes he can see more in the dark and without thinking just shines the flashlight into his eyes. She discovers horribly diliated pupils, and Ash is just screaming out in pain. Then, right after that she asks him to tell her how many stars he can see, and he's just like &quot;None. I'm blind!&quot; I don't know, maybe the way I said it isn't that funny, but I thought it was hillarious. Ash is hillarious with his little side comments and he's simply a very interesting character. It took me awhile to get myself to finally buy it, but its definetly a good read.

review/summary: Another awesome book from LJ Smith!
review/text: Daughters of Darkness, the second book in LJ Smith's Night World series, is probably the best book in the series.Mary-Lynette is the intellectual heroine in this book. She's a human obsessed with astromomy who's stumbled across a strange, supernatural secret about the new girls next door. Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade are beautiful vampire sisters who have escaped from their strict home across the country. Mary Lynette and her brother, Mark, become quick friends with the sisters, but someone doesn't want them to live in harmony.And then there's the slight problem that the girls' brother, Ash (who appeared in the first Night World book, Secret Vampire), who has come to bring his sisters back. Ash is icy cold and ruthless, but Mary Lynette might just be the person to melt his heart.This book is so awesome that you won't want to put it down until you've finished. But I would definitely recommend reading the Night World series in order, since the characters reappear and the events link together, so if you haven't read Secret Vampire yet, do that first. But if you have, definitely read this book!

review/summary: THIS IS MY FAV BOOK IN THE SERIES!!!!
review/text: This is the best book out of the Night World series. At first, in the first book, u think Ash is the bad guy, but that opinion totally goes out the window when u read this book.(The same thing w/ Quinn, but that's another book) I have all the Night World books and love them all. I've read them all over and over, but this is my fav. I can totally relate w/ the feeling of longing Mary-Lynette felt at the beginning, and like her, I am looking for someone to share the night w/ (even though i know only a little about astronomy) Ash is definantly a character. He's strong-willed, and has a smart mouth, but is vulnerable like a hurt child underneath it all. There needs to be another book that continues the story of Ash, Mary-Lynette, Mark and the sisters. Ash had small parts in Dark Angel (when he got Gillian out of that club Angel lured her in) and in Soulmates (when he was in Circle Daybreak when he met Hannah and told her about his soulmate.) If you haven't read this one yet, it is a must read. I beleive in soulmates and it makes me wish for mine even more If only the Night World really existed . . . but oh well. I hope you bring in Mary-Lynette and Ash again, I would really like to know the outcome.

review/summary: Quick and Fun
review/text: As an adult reader I gave this a 3 star because some things were not very logical. The story was well written and as a teen I think I would have given it a 4 maybe even a 5. I would not mind letting my children read this book as the love relationships are based on emotions rather than physical appearance and pleasure. The relationship between the characters are healthy, for example they do not have the male stalking the female or the female saying she is going to die without the male. Yes that is a comparison to the Twilight series, but this series was written long before Twilight was thought of.The parts I did not find logical is the fact the vampire girls were not going to use any of the powers in the new town they moved too. Why not? I get that they did not want to kill their food (people) but why not talk to each other telepathically. What is the point of not doing that? No one would have known they were doing that. Vampires are stronger than people and one girl had a hard time doing a task a human could do without a problem. Another thing that bothered me about this book is Poppy and James are not in this book. There was a thought of them for a second but I would have liked something to let me know how they were doing. Is Poppy still an illegal vampire? Did her dad except them and her living dead situation? I mean so many unanswered questions.

review/summary: Night World 2: Daughters of Darkness
review/text: Night World #2: Daughters of Darkness, by L. J. SmithFor me, "Daughters of Darkness" is the one sour note in Smith's Night World series. It was the one book in the nine book series that I had to force myself to finish (I am obsessive about finishing everything I read).The concept is interesting, but I feel it could have used better execution. As with all Night World books, the protagonist is female. Mary-Lynette is a human and unaware of the secret world of vampires, werewolves, and other spooky things that exist around her. She thinks she lives in the quietest, most boring town in the world, but that's all about to change when a series of startling events happens.When the next door neighbor goes missing just as her three nieces arrive in town, and Mary-Lynette sees them burying something in the backyard, she's immediately suspicious. Unable to leave the mystery alone, she heads next door and meets the new arrivals, who further her apprehension about the disappearance of her neighbor. The girls remind her of predators, which is unsurprising as the girls are lamia, or born vampires.The mystery of who killed the neighbor takes up a good chunk of the book, and in my opinion, is very over used. It just drags on too long, and every time there was a new twist in the whodunit, I kept thinking, "Okay, that's the end of it now...no, wait...there's more. Sigh."Ash Redfern also makes an appearance in this book (some readers may remember him from "Night World #1: Secret Vampire," where he waylaid Poppy), and is a starring character along with his sisters. Initially he's on the hunt for the three sisters, who ran away from a vampire enclave. Ash is characterized as the ultimate vampire - humans are vermin and nothing more, to him. Mary-Lynette takes an immediate dislike to him when meeting him for the first time. And here's where the potentially interesting concept comes in - Ash and Mary-Lynette are soulmates, but unlike Smith's other couples, the two can't stand each other.But something about this book just didn't do it for me. Maybe it was the overly drawn out murder mystery. Or maybe it was that the main character, Mary-Lynette, seemed dry. Or maybe even what seemed interesting - soulmates disliking each other - somehow doesn't fit in a series that's about finding your soulmate.1/5.

review/text: Let me start by saying that this was a great book like a lot of other Smith fans do hope that this book does have a sequel because i really really what to know what happens with Ash and Mary. I have read all the Night World book up to Witchlight, and for those of u how are tired of the soulmate principal then don't read the books! This is my fav book out of the N.W. series,(along with Soulmate) but i hope that Ma'lin changes her mind and desides to become a vampire. anyway if u people like romace, action, and humor then read this book. end

review/summary: An amazing story.
review/text: This has got to be one of my favorite books of the series and I have all of them but one. Mary-Lynette is one of my favorite characters in the series. I love the whole idea of vampires, witches, and shapeshifters existing. I love looking at the stars like she does. If you enjoy this book, you HAVE to read the other books in the series.

review/summary: The best Night World book - definately
review/text: This has got to be the best book I have ever read in my entire life. I thought it was really different how Mary-Lynette and Ash tried to ignore the fact that they were soulmates, and it made the story much more interesting to read. Personally, I never would have guessed that it was Jeremy who had killed the girls aunt 'cause he seemed like a relly nice guy, but I guess you should never judge a book by its cover. I really wish that there was a sequel to this book 'cause I really want to find out what happens with Ash and Mary-Lynette. This is definately the best Night World book - although they are all excellent. ~Mary

review/summary: Wow! L.J. Smith is definitely my new favorite author!
review/text: I loved this book so much! I couldn't put it down for a minute. I've read almost all of the Nightworld series, but this by far is the best. The humor and the romance that brings Ash and Mary-Lynette together is great. The ending was kind of sad though. I would definitely read any sequels to this book. I hope that there is one. For those people who think the soulmate principle is getting old, I disagree. The author should keep the theory, but add a few new twists or plots to provide conflict and interest.

review/text: This was the first book that I read in the series and I loved it! I've read it about ten times. It's such a great book. I like how Ash is suddenly turned into a complete sap after meeting his Mary-Lynette. Did anyone notice that in the other two appearances that he made (in Dark Angel and Soulmate), he talks about his soulmate? Just something to think about.

review/text: I usually hate teenage romance books, but this book is great. I love the transition the characters go through and the romance. This is my favorite Night World beacuase of its characters and sitiuations. She mixes charm, romance, and humor. This book feels like real, even though it is horror, which makes you wonder. My favorite line in the book is &quot;This is a paranormal disaster area!&quot;

review/summary: The best so far
review/text: I have read all of the Night world series up to number 9 (10 isn't out yet) and i really did like this one the best. I liked the rivalry between Ash and Jeremy, but don't think it should really be that severe. How could the two races get along, even if the vamps were more powerful, or the wolves are stupid? I have to admit the only corny part is the fact that the two pairs of soulmates are related. I just really liked this book, and think it is the best yet. I do want to see what happens to all of them later on, like say at the begining of the the battle to save the world. I just want to come back to see that Mary-Linnette and Mark are vamps, etc.

I liked Kestrel the best and wished she could be featured in her own book. I like the family history and all that. L.J has really thought all this out it seems. I also the like the plot and clonficts and how it's rexolved. I am glad that Mary-Lynette is going to do her own thing for the time being. I do reasllly want to know what happens with them though.

review/summary: Night World
review/text: I asked my sister one day to go and buy all the L.J SMITH titles I don't have.She is my favorite author because she is original and her books are spellbinding.Anyways, I got the NIGHT WORLD books. I read THE SECRET VAMPIRE and I really loved it. Then I read DAUGHTHERS OF DARKNESS and loved it more. I am a hopeless romantic and I love stories about adventure and death. I like the way she mixes both of them together without going overboard. She is my favorite author but I really wish that she could make her books come out monthly.And I wish that she could include other stories besides the soulmate principal. Like maybe a vampire killer as the main character.A totally wicked character that loves to kill. Maybe she could bring us what she feels goes through a killer's mind. There's a lot of other ways she could make us love her books,maybe if she described the NIGHT WORLD more. Maybe stopping and making the females a lot stronger instead of pitiful weaklings. Maybe they should be open-minded about becoming a vampire.Anyways, she's my favorite author and I love her books.

review/summary: the BEST nightworld ever!
review/text: It was dangerously funny. It mixed love in horror in a way Ithought never possible. I LOVE the character Ash. Actually, all thecharacters were facinating with a touch of there own. I hate the books that all the characters have the same, identical personalities to the point you're about to throw-up and this was not one of them,. My favorate part was when the sisters are hissing at Ash and Mary-Lynnette goes right up to him and kicks him in the shin and she descrides that her brother stared at her as if she had just stripped down naked and started to dance the Tango.

review/summary: Night World - Book Two
review/text: Daughters of DarknessL.J. Smith1996I continue to be surprised by how overally well-written the "Night World" books are, collectively. For young people in particular, they are quality fiction.Three young female vampires come to tiny Briar Creek, Oregon, to live with their also-vampire elderly aunt, but homicide is the word of the day, and curious neighbors Mark and Mary-Lynette quickly find themselves ensconced in the dangerous waters of the Night World -- and the even more unpredictable currents of love.I didn't quite like "Daughters" as much as "Secret Vampire", the first book in the series. The tale had a bit less... urgency... than its predecessor, and while I did like the redemption of Ash, bad-boy blonde from the first novel, the character development was again a little underexplored. But the world-building is pleasant and well-done, without info-dumping on young readers with potentially short attention spans.Again I can't help but wonder what a greater length could have done for the series -- "Daughters' "plot is a bit simplistic. The ending felt... unsatisfying.But without doubt worth a read, as I will wager the entire series will be.6.8/10

It is Ash of course that just makes this book, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it's the whole 'bad-boy' vampyre thing he's got going on that you become addicted to him! I started reading these books years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these books to anyone of any age, I mean I'm 21 now, and I still love them!

review/text: It was this book nearly 10 years ago that made me fall in love with L.J. Smith and her writing. I have read nearly everything by her in the years after my first encounter with Daughters of Darkness, yet this book remains dear to my heart. The characters pop out of the pages and you fall in love instantly with Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel...but you will especially fall in love with Ash. Look for Ash again in the 6th book of the series when he makes another appearance. This book is fantastic!

This is, by far, one of the best books I've ever read and I can't wait for STRANGE FATE to come out. For anyone who is looking for another good series by L. J.

review/summary: best of the Night World books
review/text: Jade, Kestrel, and Rowan, three vampire sisters, have left their home in secrecy. Tired of living in a society that acts as though it's stuck in the 16th century, they decided to go live with their great-aunt. Unfortunately, she's been staked, and they have no idea who did it. Things are further complicated when Ash, their brother, comes to take them back. Ash gets something of a shock, however - he finds his soulmate in the small town of Briar Creek, and she's human.If you've read the first Night world book, you'll remember Ash. Believe it or not, he gets even better in this book. It's hilarious watching the usually confident Ash try to figure out how to deal with the reality of having a human soulmate (one who kicks him at every opportunity). This book is different from all the other Night World books, in that the soulmates here do not like each other and would like to find a way not to have that bond. I consider Ash to be one of the more complex characters in the series, and this book peels away a lot of the layers. Mary-Lynnette, his soulmate, is great, because she doesn't just let Ash walk all over her - she talks back, and, like I said, she kicks him a lot. The mystery element of the book is pretty interesting, and I liked the three sisters, although the author doesn't really go into as much depth with their characters as you might think she does from what the back of the book says. This book is less about the sisters and more about the murder, Ash, and Mary-Lynnette.

review/summary: Daughters of Darkness, a love story in a supernatural series
review/text: Personally, I feel this book is the best in the Night World series, because I love the character Ash. He is such a hottie, though he has many personality flaws and actions to be ashamed of. That just makes him a more realistic character. Mary-Lynette and the rest of the characters are well thought-out also, and I hope to read about them in the future. This is my favorite series of L.J. Smith's, because in incorporates all creatures of the night. I look forward to reading Huntress and Black Dawn, since I've read all the other Night World books numerous times already, to indulge my fantasy craving mind. My only disappointment is that there are no shapeshifter soulmates. They must be just as intriguing as witches and vampires. And why can't I find Volume one of the Vampire Diaries anywhere? That series must be out of print, though it isn't old

review/summary: Murder, mystery, werewolves, vampire and soulmates
review/text: Daughters of Darkness is the second book in the Night World series and centres around three groups of people - Mark and Mary Lynette Carter, two siblings who are wannabe astronomers, Rowan, Kestral and Jade Redfern, three vampire sisters escaping the confining life their previous home the vampire conclave, and Ash Redfern, their elder brother who's come to drag them home and successfully has L.J. Smith fans swooning in the aisles.It is an interesting premise, and things start to heat up when the girls arrive at their great-aunt Opal Burdock's house in Briar Creek only to find her staked through the heart. Panicking, they bury the body in the garden outside, but are witnessed by Mary-Lynette who's watching the stars on the hill overlooking the house. Doubtful that Mrs Burdock is really dead, Mary-Lynette and her brother nevertheless investigate, and come across the vampire sisters hunting in the wood...However, because Mark and Jade fall pretty fast for each other a truce is made and the sisters share their fears with the two siblings - something is out there, something that's killing things, and all of them work their dectective skills to figure out who it is ... Ash? Bunny Marten, the shop attendant with the lamia name? Jeremy, the garage worker with a deep, dark secret? A vampire hunter?And then Ash turns up, and to his and Mary-Lynette's horror, they find they are soulmates, destined to be together even though Ash is not a very nice guy.The story is pretty interesting, and it's fun to guess whodunnit, though I admit I was a *little* disappointed as to the murderer's motives. L.J. Smith obviously had fun designing the three sisters, all with different personalities and features. For once there wasn't a contrived happy ending that is so popular in L.J. Smith's books, and the atmosphere of the book was very well done too - the desert-like Briar Creek gave a sense of being trapped in the middle of nowhere with a wild beast on the loose, and chemistry between all the characters was realistic, poignent, and sometimes funny. (Watch out for Ash giving Jeremy a hard time).All in all, this was a much better book than the first 'Secret Vampire', which extented the Night World a bit, and mingled together characters that have been in previous books (Ash) and characters who'll appear in future ones (Quinn).

review/summary: Worth a read
review/text: Book 2 of the Night World series, Daughters of Darkness, shifts focus to a new set of characters of the secret society. Relatives of James from the first book, we meet Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade. They are three vampire sisters who snuck away from home. Tired of the secret society, they want to try to live as humans out in Oregon. They move into a dilapidated old home, next to Mark and Mary-Lynette Carter. As Jade and Mark get closer, their brother Ash comes to town to bring his sisters back. Of course, he meets Mary-Lynette and things get interesting...Ash, the handsome blondie who we remember from the first book as being a conniving, selfish, and manipulative, experiences a bit of growth in this book. In the first book you would have never thought it would happen, but I was glad to see the character development.What I like about the Night World books is that while you could read each book separately as a stand-alone, it's great to see prior plot lines and character weaved into the current story. It makes you feel even more connected to the story and the world.These books are short reads, but I find them pretty satisfying because the plot moves along and it focuses on what you really want to see.

review/summary: Vampires And Mystery? You'd Be Surprised
review/text: Mary-Lynnette's wants seem simple enough. She likes her quiet life, stargazes as a hobby, bases her life around becoming an astronomer, and hopes the three new girls moving in next door with the kindly, if eccentric, Mrs. Burdock will help to bring her shy brother, Mark, out of his shell.Unfortunately, what she ends up with is a murder mystery, romance she doesn't want, and oh, yeah, those three new girls are vampires with a dangerous older brother coming to drag them back home.There are a LOT of characters to focus on, as per usual with a murder mystery. We have Mary-Lynnette, Mark, the three sisters Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade, their brother Ash, and the local werewolf, Jeremy. And those aren't even the suspects. The endless supply of characters in such a short amount of pages is a little overwhelming, with so many aspects of so many characters not fully explored. But what really gets the reader, even the fans of over ten years, is the star-crossed attraction between Mary-Lynnette and Ash.It's a bumpy road, to put it lightly. Mary-Lynnette is a simple, if nosy, human girl, while Ash is a dangerous, well-known vampire--and not well-known in the good sense, in Mary-Lynnette's book. Understandable; in Secret Vampire and Daughters of Darkness it's implied he's killed human girls and worse. There are very subtle hints at sexual abuse toward human females that younger readers may miss, but the words are enough to paint a picture that Ash is Very Bad.Many fans complain at the ending, but it is the ending that keeps them so captivated with these two. Mary-Lynnette wants to finish high school. She can't see herself with Ash as he is now, knowing his past. Ash is sorry and wants to repent, by the end of the novel, but wanting isn't enough. Mary-Lynnette is dealing with a soulmate who is potentially mentally unstable, definitely cruel, and by all human means, a classified felon (if he could be traced, that is).L.J. Smith did well in ending the story with no conclusion (which she has promised the fans would come at the end of the series for years; ten years later and still nothing). Ash needs room to grow in order to be someone Mary-Lynnette will not regret willingly falling in love with.This is a good book, by no means the best, but excellent for the series. It was the second book I read (no, Secret Vampire was not the first) and ultimately the one that got me hooked.Here's to hoping the Mary-Lynnette/Ash fans get closure in the near future. Publishers, don't keep faithful fans in suspense!

review/summary: Excellent, one of the best
review/text: I, LOVE this book. It is by far the best of L.J.Smiths Night World books. I can only find one flaw. No-one, and i mean no-one would just let a hunky guy like Ash just walk away? I mean Come On! As if. OK so what he's done some bad things but hey, you'll get over it. What if something happens to him while he's away and the last thing you said was "nice line". But okay that's fine, you wanna let him go? OK. But when do we get to find out if and when he and Mary Lynette get back together? That's just mean not telling us that. But besides that downfall the book was excellent and I love the way L.J.Smith described how they all turned really beautiful after they had fed. Heeheehee.Neways gotta go, hope you all enjoy/d the book as much as I did.Jess

review/summary: My favorite Night World book!
review/text: This is my favorite book in L.J. Smith's uniformly excellent Night World Series. I've read it about a million times, and it never gets tired. I love the romance between Mary Lynette and Ash. The idea of soulmates is very exciting, and the scenes between the two of them are perfect. My favorite part is when Mary Lynette quotes Pride and Prejudice and Ash responds the same way, shocking her. Sigh. If you haven't read this book, get thee to a bookstore, a library, whatever and start right away!

review/summary: One of my favourites
review/text: In Daughters of Darkness, LJ Smith outdoes herself. Three beautiful sisters hide a deadly secret that threatens to be discovered by the inhabitants of a sleepy town. Rowan, Kestrel and Jade are on the run - from their families and from the Elders. They know that their brother Ash (James' cousin from Secret Vampire) is seeking them and that he is bent on returning them to the boring life they have led.Two siblings chance upon their secret and find themselves befriending vampires. As they learn more about the Night World, their own lives are turned upside down by a sickening deed. Who or what is it that stalks Briar Creek?Fantastic! I enjoyed this book immensely with its portrayal of two very different and yet similar families. The obvious difference is the species but the vampire girls have never had true freedom before while Mary-Lynette and Mark have lived their lives in a small town in the country. The similarities lie in the older sisters. Both fiercely protective of their siblings, they will do anything to keep them from harm.I loved the conflict between Ash and M'Lin, especially when they first meet. The story progressed well and unlike some stories, had a more convincing ending, rather than the sudden death of the baddie. This was one of my favourites in the series and I am still waiting anxiously for Strange Fate, which is the 10th.

review/summary: The best book in the &quot;Night World&quot; Series
review/text: Daughters of Darkness is quite possibly the best book in the new NIGHT WORLD series by L. J. Smith. It does not just revolve around one supernatural being or one singular person, it has interesting information on the werewolves of the NIGHT WORLD and the plot line is out of sight. I own all of the books in the series (Up untill Soulmate that is) and so far Daughters of Darkness is the best one. I only hope the following books in this wonderful series are as great as this one!!

review/text: Compared to the rest of the Nightworld Series it's on a par with The Chosen, that's to say it's good but it's no Witchlight. The best thing about this one is that it centres around everyone's favourite Bad Boy Ash. His soulmate seems like a bit of a weakling at first but you'll soon warm to her.

review/summary: One of her best in the Night World series!
review/text: Out of all L.J.Smiths works this is one of my most highly recommended. If you have read any other books in the Night World series you will have recognized Ash(one of the main characters), who seems to pop up in many scenes. The heroine Mary Lynette is also one of my favorite characters. During the entire novel she dosn't appear as shaken as most would after learning of the Night World,finding her soulmate vampire and befriending 3 rogue vampires. Even if this series is unrealistic what better kind of book to lose yourself in. I find the whole concept of the Night World,wild powers and soulmates fascinating,this book is worth it.

review/text: STARNGE FATE come out already! i've been waiting for this book for like a millenium.! oh yah, where was i? DOD is a superb book and i really loved Ash and ML. they are two drastically different characters except for their love for the night and as ML says, &quot;basically incompatible with each other...&quot;! well, i agree with that . they're even dif. in terms of looks and thinking. one black one white. no wonder there is so much problems circling this pair of soulmates. even on the net, i notice most of the fanfics are about ML and Ash and their *swoon* neverending love for ach other. however, they are AWFULLY insecure bout each other. i really hope Ms. Smith will write a book about them to clear up the loose ends........... well, not a boo maybe. but a loong part in a book to let us know the final of this love tragedy? *HOPEFUL*

review/summary: It is the best book in the series.
review/text: This book was the best out of the whole series. The book was pretty much about Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel, three girl vampires that just had enough of the Night World. Mary-Lynnette is a small town girl who loves to look at the stars, but has nobody to look at the stars with her. Ash is a tall, lanky, and elegant vampire that has to find his sisters and bing them back home. But of course his sisters had told Mary-Lynnette and her brother, Mark, bout the Night World. Another twist in the story is that Ash and Mary-Lynnette are soulmates. If this story couldn't get anymore exciting there is a vampire killer running around town. All six of them has to figure out who this vampire killer is and stop him. Meanwhile Ash and Mary-Lynnette has to figure out what to do about each other. If you like or are obsess with vampires (Like me!)you should read this book.

review/text: You might have read a lot of vampire-romance novels but this one certainly rates a 10. The story itself has a good plot and amazing characters to suit their purposes. The three sisters, Rowan, Kestrel and Jade, uncannily beatiful, are actually fugitives from Night World and their brother Ash is sent to take them home. Both male and female lead role are superb. Their roles fit them perfectly. Ash, a vampire whose whole life changed after finding his soulmate is a human and Mary-Lynette a girl with a strong character who wasn't really willing to accept the fact that Ash is her soulmate. And of course...the way the authour tells her story and the words she uses..it's absolutely incredible.

Her writing style is very natural and realistic and her characters are so real, you start looking for them in real life. I fell in love with Ash, especially in how, even though he's a fierce vampire, he's completely helpless when it comes to Mary Lynette. Smith writes the most wonderful characters. I never liked fantasy or romance novels, but her books are a notable exception. My friends think I'm crazy because I'm in college and I'm still reading YA books, but, I'm telling you, her books are ageless!!! If you haven't read this, you're definitely missing out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: A love story for haters of love and romance
review/text: Thought you would never ever fall in love? So did the hero (if you can call him that) of this story. Ash doesn't particularly like the idea of having to chase his little sisters across the country after they ran away from home. And when he finds them he doesn't exactly love the idea that they have also told humans about the Night World, a secret society of the supernatural. Or the idea that his youngest sister is in love with a human. But what's worse is Ash's soulmate is a smart, beautiful human from a hick town who hates him and everything he stands for. Also, what's worse, his great-aunt is killed with a stake meaning that somebody knew she was a vampire. All this adds up to the worst thing that can happen to a teenage boy who wants to prove that he hates humans, loves fast cars and even faster girls. This is the funniest, most ludicrous book you could ever expect to read from L.J.Smith. The characters are SOO familiar, you might expect to see them in school the next day. A must read for readers of all ages and COMEDY CENTRAL lovers.

review/summary: THE ABSOUITE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: L J really outdid herself this time, this was undoubtedly one of the best books she has ever written. if you dont have this book, or don't like it, there is something serouisly wrong with your head, and you need to go see a doctor ASAP!!! I love the part where Ash and Beth are walking in the woods. What they both say and do are and is soooooo roamanitic. I always wish that the night world were real!! I wish I could have a vampire soulmate, the idea of becoming a vampire is really cool, i would love to become one. I don't know whats wrong with Beath!! You can tell Ash loves her from almost the begining.. the first time I read the book, i didnt get one part, but as u can see, i'm not dissing the book for it... the part where ash says &quot;Look...I might as well tell you. I didn't ask for this, and if somebody had said last week that I'd be in...involved... with a human, I'd have knocked his head off. I mean, after howels of derisive laughter. But.&quot; I doidn't catch what he was origenally goning to say... I'd be in LOVE, but he paused and changed the word love to involved. so while she sat there hating him, he loved her!! How blind can a girl get!! theres a fine guy there trippin over her, and she kickes him in the shin!!! twice!oh well. what I really want it a sequel though. I am just dien wonderin what happens. the lasy part where he said goodbye was soo good. If L J ever stops writing I am going to be sooooooo sad. but in conclusion, this was one of her best books. And hey, if u know any of her fan club addresses, e-mail me. I only just discovered the wonder that is LJ Smith. I only have 4 of her books, but am ordering the rest soon. THANK Y O U ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: The best of the Night World books
review/text: Why can't Ash be real? I am so in love with him. I think L.J. Smith should stop writing the Night World series. Its watered down. The only really good book was Daughters of Darkness (the Chosen was good too) I think she should stick to triologies, so we can become really attached to those characters, i.e. Julian (still not over his death) Gabriel, Nick, and Stefan. Read all of her trilogies...even better than all her Night World stuff.

review/text: L.J. Smith is the best author in the whole world. I read this book a year ago but I can't stop reading it. It is beyond sweet. I love Ash.The entire Night World seris is the bomb. I read mostly everyone of L.J Smiths book and they all are awesome. I think Ash and Mary Lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates. I loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldn't. There should be real guys like Ash,Quinn,Juliun,Damon,Gabriel and I can go on forever. I think everyone should read at least one L.J Smith book. If you do you'll be hooked on them for life,like I am. L.J Smith is the BEST!!!!

review/text: I've only read up to Soulmate of the Night World series, but sofar Ihappen to be in agreement with almost all the other reviewers: Ash is my favourite male character!!! Did anyone notice that (so far) only Ash and Mary-Lynnette tried to fight their attraction? But why was it called &quot;Daughters of Darkness&quot; when Rowan, Kestrel and Jade weren't actually the main characters?P.S. I think L. J. Smith should let more characters become vampires. And how come all the main-character vampires are all male and the witches female???

review/text: I'm writng again to say that this book has so many correct details, and the other books in this series are correct too. For instance, Speelbound has it right calling the Salem witch hunts the Burning Times. real witches do to. Isis is a a major person in witchcraft, and Hecate was the first witch. L.j Smith might as well be a wtich or vampire or whatever else for all the right details she has

Smith, and I can't wait until &quot;Huntress&quot; comes out. I just started reading her books last summer. I have since then tried to read all her books and recruit my friends to get hooked. Ash and Mary-Lynnette are extremely convincing characters, as are all the characters from the book. You can really see Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade from Lisa J.'s descriptions. You can totally understand the characters, and can almost believe they are real! READ THIS BOOK

review/summary: Another wonderful book!!!
review/text: Mary-Lynette was just a normal girl that loved the night. Until she meets three vampire sisters that are fugitives from the Night World. Then she meets their brother, Ash, a true vampire. He's come back for his sisters. Then, when he shakes hands with Mary-Lynette, he finds his soulmate, a human, which he called vermin. He wants her more than anything, and he wont leave her. He asks her if she wants to become a vampire, to go with him, but she says no. The vampires aunt had been staked when they arrived, and then a staked goat shows up on their front porch. Who staked them? Is it a vampire hunter or a vampire? Will Mary-Lynette go with Ash? Or had destiny made a mistake making them soulmates?This is a wonderful book. I couldnt believe who it was that was the killer. The ending I couldnt believe either.

Her bravery towards the cat like ash blond boy is amusing and gives the story a great twist. Reluctant lovers. This book has humor, suspense, and a bit of a murder mystery. Oh yah and a pincushion goat. What more could you want. Oh yeah , I'll mention Ash again! ( ohh and I have to say that the covers of the Night world seris in Europe do the book much more justice!!!)

review/text: I admit, the story was great. But it was also tiring. I think it needs more description about the surroundings, and the characters. I admit, it's nice to have little soulmates wandering the world blissfully, but I was really glad that in this book, it wasn't the case. But despite that nice turn of events, it does not change the fact that, well, this book tends to asume everyone likes happy endings full of love. Those endings are great, but I felt this one could have used a twist, or unusual ending. Instead of the evil vampire being reformed and changed, maybe he should leave in a rage or something like that However, I still hope you'll read it, after all, it is entertainment.

review/summary: The best Night World book ever!!!!
review/text: &quot;Daughters of Darkness&quot; was the first book in the Night World series that I ever read (and the second book by LJ Smith) and it just got me hooked. I think it was Ash that did it. He's so amazingly wonderful! (Along with Gabriel, Quinn, and Julian.) L.J. Smith is a terrific writer, and all of her books have good character development and description (especially of the guys). Not to mention that this book was hilarious at times. I was cracking up during Mary-Lynnette's encounters with Ash. And to think, I almost didn't read this book after I took it out of the library! It's a good thing I had nothing to do that day! Read it, and any other L.J. Smith book you can get your hands on! -LEX

review/summary: Honest Straight Forward Advice
review/text: Earlier this year I made the decision to become a real estate agent. Due to previous experiences in other lines of work and the fact that I have yet to find a job that pays anywhere near what would merit the astronomical cost of my education I am very careful. I am immediately skeptical of anyone who wants me to pay them to enhance my career. When I came across Mario's videos on youtube it was very refreshing. There were no bells and whistles or promises of a program that would make you rich, just a friendly looking man sitting in his home office doling out advice. I am honest and straight forward by nature so I was interested in seeing what Mario was all about. This DVD takes his youtube videos a step further and spells out several fantastic ways to be spending your time during your first 30 days as a real estate agent.... Also, Mario left his office and moved to a fancier studio to produce the dvds. I've got some great ideas from watching the DVD. Even if you have been in the business for more than 30 days it might be a good idea to check this one out to make sure you are on the right track.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I bought this book because I am a nonogram (also called Paint By Number) addict, and can't get enough of this type of puzzle. My disappointment is not so much with the quality of the puzzles within it but with the quality of the publishing. The paper is poor quality; it won't hold up under much erasing if you use pencil, and if you use gel pens, the ink bleeds through to the other side. The squares to color in are too large, making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out. Also, the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle, instead of left and top, making it more difficult for a right-handed person to see while solving.Save your money, and buy the Games Magazine publication instead.

review/summary: Great puzzles, bad format
review/text: I really enjoy doing the type of puzzles in this book, but I've come to realize that having them in a large-format book with wire binding is an absolute necessity. All the Non Ishida Sunday Telegraph books are printed in mass-market paperback form on cheap pulp paper (which easily rips if you use mechanical pencils like I do). The book is also very small (only 7 inches tall and 4 1/2 inches wide) and is bound like a regular paperback, so it's hard to keep open while you're trying to complete the puzzles. The other major problem with this series is that many of the puzzles are large, so that in order to fit them in the book, the publishers have broken up the grid to fit half on one page and half on the other! I get so frustrated, I want to cut the puzzles out the book and tape them to another sheet of paper before I do them.I'd suggest Mind-Sharpening Pixel Puzzles and Perplexing Pixel Puzzles, both by Peter Gordon, or Games Magazine Presents Paint by Numbers instead of these books, because of their large format and quality paper.

review/summary: Fun little book of puzzles
review/text: For those who are fans of 'Paint by Numbers,' a puzzle that has taken the world by storm over the past decade, this book doesn't disappoint. Filled with lots of different art puzzles with the simplest of clues (a series of numbers), the final result never ceases to astonish.The one nit-pick I have is that the book is small, meaning the puzzles don't get that big either. As the puzzle has grown in popularity, so has the size of the puzzle, creating a more challenging atmosphere. These puzzles, by comparison, feel more like a beginner's version. But they're still fun and the results are, as usual, cool.

review/text: We were surprised. Pleasantly.A weighty, perfect model of this classic screen would certainly not be available for anything close to the price of the Uniflame model, but the Uniflame looks amazingly good anyway. This thing does the trick!We bought it to replace an "original" solid brass model costing nearly $500 (and it's cheap construction design eventually giving way to its heaviness when moved). As long as someone doesn't examine the new screen from close-up, it actually looks better (not really terrible at all close-up), and it's lighter weight makes it easy to handle.JRT

review/summary: Scraped across the whole top.
review/text: Purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top. The box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material, but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom. However, since it was in another smaller box, I'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with, and not from shipping. Still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage. I wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and I really need a screen right now. Other than the damage, it's a very nice screen.

review/summary: A superb snapshot of Colonial America up to 1750.
review/text: The brilliant historian Richard Hofstadter was working on this book when he died in 1970. In eight highly readable chapters he presents clear discussions of several areas of Colonial America, among them: the explosion in population, the diverse ethnicity, the world of white indentured servents, black slavery and its trade, along with a discussion of the predominant middle class life many enjoyed, and finishes with three fine chapters on Colonial religion and the Great Awakening. His mastery of his subject matter and the clarity of his writing is a joy. The Scotch-Irish, the German religious sects who were excellent farmers, the terrified blacks kidnapped and marched 550 miles to the coast and into slavery, the desperate white indentured servents selling themselves into virtual slavery for a time, the always extremely dangerous ocean crossings, the greedy-yet terrified slaveholders and the cruel slave codes they wrote, the relatively prosperous Americans, the coming of G! ! eorge Whitefield--America's most spectacular preacher, the religious schisms that the Great Awakening brought: all these stories are here. And all packed into a highly readable book. A pleasure to read. Thank you Professor Hofstadter.

review/summary: a sadly incomplete yet fully realized work
review/text: This is a magnificent work of historical imagination. Hofstadter's last book, it was what was to begin a much larger, possibly three volume epic on the social conditions of America at distinctive periods in our history. And while this book is missing the fuller vision of a more articulated society, the chapters that are present are truly alive with insight and understanding of the way things probably were. Here we see the slave trade not just from a one-sided arcadia, but from every side, from the profiteers and the oppressed, from the African kings selling their nation to the early-day abolitionists mildly arguing their case. We see the white slaves too, the pains and humiliations of indentured servitude to the hearts and minds of men believing themselves at the very least a step up from inhumanity.Then there is the middle class of the pre-revolutionary colonies, filled with religious fanatics and patriotic zealots, all of them looking to make a buck. We see that this class formed the basic foundations of the nation to come and how the politicians of the day catered mostly to this hardly regal, far-reaching group of normal, everyday folks. This chapter, perhaps, gives the fullest picture of the society that was that went on to create the society we are today.And then there is a long discussion of the church and the 'Great Awakening' that plundered through the minds of so many post-witch hunting citizens. These chapters explain the foundations that led not just to a seperation of church and state, but to the required need for religious diversity and how this principle, above all else, came to found our subsequent ideas on American freedom.A glorious, neccessary book, it makes one mourn for this already celebrated historian and wonder what might have been (and regardless of that annoying cliche, one can't help but think in such basic praise dialect when finishing).

review/summary: mirroring the reader
review/text: I find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy, boring and a waste of time. Hofstader, a brilliant and yet very human scholar, has offered us a wonderfully concise, compelling and illuminating read - a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation. He has done all the work, not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoon-feeding us his unsubstantiated opinion, but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy, very readable manner. The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under review.Bravo Professor Hofstader. I regret that you did not live to complete your masterpiece.

review/summary: An Enlightening Step in All Americans' Past
review/text: One of History's saddest events, I mean in the discipline of History, was the premature death of Richard Hofstader.With this book, the last he wrote, not finishing it, he also was making a turn in his writing career. Most of his previous work was analytic social history, more like sociology than what the popular mind may consider as history. Although that work was excellent and he proved himself an accomplished essayist, with this one he proves he has an excellent touch with narrative history. He can still singe right through to the heart of what makes the period studied a period that, whatever our superficial technological guises, we still live in.We have moved past slavery, which was so entrenched in American social structure in 1750. But the persistence with which Americans pursued slavery, as if they perceived it was the only way to build a nation and a new kind of nation, one built purely on self-interest, brings the reader to realize that the nation we live in now remains built on slavery. The vast semi-middle classes and lower classes remain slaves to their debased tastes, their lives must remain empty and out of their will's control so that their master's, the tiny set of property and power holders, may prosper and keep building, all for their own prospering only. At the same time, the masters tell these slaves it is all done for the glory of--back then it was "God," now it is sometimes "God" and sometimes everyday mammon.Hofstadter also lets us see the centrality of religion in everyday American life at the same, another factor which has altered only superficially. If America continues to punish the flesh and look to some vague point in the future when God will make everything right, the precedence was there at 1750. If now we seem to live for today, it is not in terms of fully enriching ourselves within the potentials of this world below, but only in terms of momentary indulgences to keep us preoccupied until some dim future when all will be resolved and explained. Candy and candy music are the so-called indulgences, much as prayers and verse-reading were the momentary indulgences to keep the body bearing through this world until the next appeared.Always, Hosftadter reveals, without preaching. The reader can draw the conclusions, even if Hofstadter's brilliant supply of facts leads the careful reader to see the connections between yesterday and today. Considering this book came out four decades ago, it teaches a hard lesson, that the more America thinks it progresses, the more it becomes its same old self.

review/summary: Time again to read the liberal idea of America
review/text: AMERICA AT 1750: A Social Portrait, by Richard Hofstadter. 293 pages. Knopf.This is a good time to read (or re-read) the histories of Richard Hofstadter, who explained the background of McCarthyism. McCarthyism is back, big time. The foreground is different. The background is the same.Hofstadter's writing career, 1944-1970, was almost exactly congruent with the first McCarthyism, and his gracefully written books were bestsellers among lovers of American liberty.The titles of the best-known reveal his thrust: "Anti-intellectualism in American Life": "The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays"; "Social Darwinism in American Thought"; "The Development of Academic Freedom in the United States."When he passed the age of 50, Hofstadter projected a massive social history of America, which would require 18 years to write. He died after completing only eight chapters of a scene-setting volume, which were published as "America at 1750" in 1971.So this little volume is a good place to start before returning to his earlier volumes. It was Hofstadter's opinion that by 1750, peculiarly American attitudes, customs, institutions and morals had formed after six or seven generations away from Europe, and that these were so powerful they still controlled much that we did two centuries later.He was certainly a believer in American exceptionalism, but unlike the antidemocratic, antiliberal ranters about American exceptionalism today, he did not think that everything America did and stood for was wise or benevolent; nor that anyone who dared to criticize our failings was a less than 100 percent American.The chapter headings reveal that. After an opening review of demographics, his first three substantive chapters are on forced labor, white and black; and the capitalist slave trade.Only after reminding us that America was a deeply flawed place does he begin writing about its attractive aspects in "The Middle Class World."One aspect of American exceptionalism is that it was history's first majority middle class community.Hofstadter died too soon to remonstrate against the destruction of the middle class in favor of finance capitalism, but he was aware of the threat.His final three chapters are about religion, particularly the Great Awakening in the 1740s.Until then, Americans were unchurched, in the main, although there were established churches in many colonies that taxed everybody.But believers and unbelievers who disdained to pay for someone else's church were free to move, and did.Americans evolved a wholly secular idea of government, not because they were irreligious (which they weren't even if unchurched) but because no sect (after the early days in New England) could command the adherence of a large enough majority to persecute the rest. Thus, the idea of toleration, which was, for most, limited to toleration of Protestants.But it was a good start.

review/summary: Breaks Up the Monotony, In My Opinion
review/text: To give you a little insight on my opinion, I was assigned to do an "outside reading" for my U.S. History class and I picked this out of the list of acceptable books. This book really does pack a lot of information into it for you, and it breaks up the monotony of facts and locations by throwing in little stories, examples, and quotes, which give history a little more "personal" feeling. The first chapter is a real snoozer, dealing mostly in population figures and growth, but it picks up from there. I also found the last few chapters on religion and the Great Awakening a little redundant, but still interesting.

I even go so far as to say reading it is a complete waste of time, because the energy you must invest to understand this work' coupled witht the frustration of an endlessly boring stlye does not even compared to the information you will actually get out of it.

review/text: To read this book you need to be fully awake and have full concentration. This is not the type of book to bring to the beach. Though Richard Hofstadter makes a convincing case of what colonial times were like and he obviously was a scholar, he writes very monotonously. if not thouroughly interested in american history at 1750 i would not recommend this book. otherwise, if you are a history-fanatic, this book gives a wide range of perspectives and fully covers the history of the time.

review/summary: Chocolate
review/text: This is a great single to buy. CHOCOLATE is one of my favorites from her vastly underrated BODY LANGUAGE album. The song oozes with sexuality, and it's easily the sexiest song she's ever sung. What a treat to have some mixes, including the Emo Mix and Tom Iddleton's Cosmos Mix. Great mixes! There is also a live version of "Love At First Sight" from her MONEY CANT BUY special that was used to promote the BODY LANGUAGE album. The unreleased track "City Games" was rumored to be the first single from that album, but it never made the album and was said to have never existed. It's a nice song. The video for CHOCOLATE is also on here, one of her best if you ask me. A wonderful single worth buying!

review/summary: Addicted to Chocolate
review/text: Kylie Minogue's third single from BODY LANGUAGE has perhaps the best packaging of them all. The track that had been rumored to lead off a new direction for Kylie, CITY GAMES, is included here, even after the record company's bald-faced claims that it did not exist. Great news, but unfortunately it isn't a new direction for anyone concerned. However the BODY LANGUAGE LIVE version of last year's sensation LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT shows Kylie at her most exuberant, it's apparently a song she loves to sing and she does so with enormous gusto and style. And the audience loves her back.As for CHOCOLATE itself, I wasn't too keen on hearing it on the LP, but the new version is hugely catchy, and the video is strange and freakishly beautiful. Kylie's costumes are all in a very rich range of Renaissance (or really Pre-Raphaelite) colors, and extremely rich fabrics, damaska, silks, I suppose to give the corresponding visual equivalent to the sweetness and meltingness of chocolate. The choreography is jagged and awkward, very Martha Graham, and then in the middle section Kylie tries a pas de deux with a younger (male) dancer and brings it off surprisingly well. There are some endearing "experimental" moments as well, very Maya Deren (a group of dancers revolving on a spinning plate move back in the camera to reveal they are actually dancing on Kylie's hat!) and quite overwrought, like chocolate . . .

review/summary: Sumptuous....
review/text: As a Kylie fan for the last 17 years (ouch), I have been very disappointed with her output recently - 'Slow' was interesting and 'Red Blooded Woman' was ok. The Album 'Body Language' was hugely disappointing for me, by all means, try a new musical direction, but at least make it interesting.'Chocolate', the 3rd single from the BL album and was always a standout track in my opinion. Sumptious, soft, sexy vocals, and a chilled, mid tempo beat, this is Kylies strongest single in some time.As for the cd itself... the newly re-recorded single version is gorgeous, the Middleton Cosmos mix is just rubbish (hardly any vocals, and nothing that sounds like the original), the EMO mix is excellent (a different, slightly edgier beat but retains the essence of the original), and a new song, 'City Games', which is probably better than most of the tracks off the album.The live version of the ultra poppy and wondeful 'Love at first sight' proves she can hold a note well.Also included is the very stylish and beautiful ballet(ish) themed video...This cd is a reminder of a Kylie passed - its still a different style to what we are used to from her, but it still contains that glorious Kylie element, something fans have been deprived of recently.

review/summary: Kylie takes a bite at subtlety....
review/text: Kylie Minogue isn't a very subtle performer - she's famous for hi-NRG floorfillers, not purring ballads. A ballad in the hands of a pop singer can be a nightmare but with Kylie, it's a dream and CHOCOLATE is a perfect example of it. Sweet and slow, it flows like its namesake throughout, with a catchy chorus that will for sure melt her fans down. Remixed for release, this CD also includes the funky CITY GAMES, two remixes (the EMO mix is the better one) and a live track, taken from her BODY LANGUAGE LIVE DVD, which should receive a late 2004 release in the USA.

review/text: "Chocolate" is the 3rd Single from "Body Language", and can be named as a Classic !This Song can be described as Sexy, Seductive, Delicious, Breath Taking at the same time, obviously another Amazing track performed by Kylie Minogue.Kylie delivered to us an exquisite ballad with a fresh sound, necesary for the radio audience of Today. The Lyrics of the song are great too, here is a little fragment that describes the track better:"If love were liquid it would drown me, In a placeless place would find me, In a heart shape come around me and then, Melt me slowly down"The Single contains the Excellent song, 2 mixes (The Tom Middleton Mix & the EMO Mix), a Live version of the Smash Hit Single "Love At First Sight" (Recorded at the "Money Can Buy" show), a Previously Unreleased track called "City Games", plus the Spectacular & Classy Chocolate VideoObviously, "Chocolate" is one of the best singles of 2004 and this package (the Australian Version) is one of those CD's that you have to Buy. You Won't regret It.Thanks For Reading this Review =)

review/summary: Highlight Of BODY LANGUAGE
review/text: As with the previous two singles from her sorely overlooked BODY LANGUAGE set, Minogue manages to go for something light years away from what many consider her given forte', that being straight up dance music. It's a shame that the singles from the album have met with only modest success(and the album itself even less so). This is another first-rate track, probably the best on the album, though I must say the re-recorded single version dwarfs in comparison to the magnificent album version, which may have not been considered "commercial" enough for radio.The remixes here are fine, the bonus track "City Games"(rumored to be the original choice as the album's title track) not so much, and the video lovely. Unfortunately, this looks to be the last single from BL--I suspect in the not-so-distant future we will witness the return of Disco/Dance Kylie with a "Can't Get You Out Of My Head" beat pulsing not too far behind.

Ok, here it is track-by-track:1. Chocolate [Radio Edit]:While this cuts the album version of the song by one minute and two seconds, it's better. Her vocals are improved, & more of an arrangement is used. 10/102. City Games: THis extreme rarity is fabulous. Very R&B; pop. 10/103. Chocolate [Tom Middleton Cosmos Remix]: A club dub. Cool when you have so much energy in you that you have to dance it out, but not for a regular listen. 7/104. Chocolate [EMO Mix]: Woderful. A good R&B; dance mix of the song. 9/105. Love @ First Sight [Live]: A live version of the Fever hit. I usually love live sounds, but this when isn't quite up to par with the original. 8/10I still have yet to figure out how to access the video. (...)Overall great package, great mixes, great rarities.

review/summary: Kylie knows how to please her listeners with Chocolate
review/text: Chocolate was the last single to be up-lifted from her Body Language album. Chocolate reached #5 in Australia, and #4 in the UK. This track was one of Kylie's favorite songs from the BL project. This song is certainly a treasure with it's beautiful lyrics and a perfection of a ballad rhythm. *Note: Usually when you buy the Australian version of a single, you're included extra rarities like enhanced media, and unreleased songs. I recommend you buy any Australian single from this wonderful artist.*1.) Chocolate 4:02 - This is known as the "Radio Edit" on her Ultimate Kylie CD. It goes directly into the song without the long intro like the album version. This version has a deeper pulse of beats and sounds more "live". Her vocals are vocoded and the instruments plays a louder part in the song. I prefer this version better because the pulse for it to be a ballad is incredible. It's a down-tempo romantic ballad transformed to a pop power ballad is truly essential. With lyrics like "Chocolate/come here/zoom in and catch the smile/there's no doubt/it's for you/i'm addicted tonight." Kylie sure knows how to please her chocolate lovers =). *****2. City Games 3:44 - A unreleased song from the Body Language sessions. This song has a rhythmic beat of 80s robotic slicks and rnb beats with a mixture of slow rap lyrics. I think the reason why this song wasn't included because her vocal range on this song is deeper and not as "alto" like the songs that where on the BL album. This is a fun 80s pop song, definetly a floorfiller to dance too. *****3. Chocolate ( Tom Middleton Cosmos Mix ) 7:31 - The longest track on the single, it stars off with her sounding like she's in the galaxy far away. Her vocals becomes more clearer saying "waited so long" in the beginning as the song progresses. The beat is a late night lounge mix, slow and danceable. The beat has its ray galaxy sounds. This song is mostly vocal free which is the downfall to this mix. Basically sounds like a "dub". This is the strongest mix besides the EMO Mix. **** 1/24. Chocolate ( EMO Mix) 4:32 - At the beginning at the song you have claps and BPM beats. The vocals are at the whispering range. As this song gets deeper, it sounds like a Livegig in a poets night club. This song has its ups and downs. The lyrics really dosen't fit this mix. The beat and the lyrics dosen't match. The advantage that this song has over the Tom Middleton Mix is that the vocals are more present and complete. ****5. Love At First Sight ( Live ) 4:59 - A bonus track basically from her Body Language Live DVD. The live video transformed to audio format. A really good live version of Love At First Sight. Just a little more extended than the original album version. A great track to listen too if you want to sing like your live. ****6. Chocolate ( Video) - The treat starts here. The Chocolate video is more laid back and down-toned than her Slow and Red Blooded Woman video. This video has her like in a french setting with ballet dancers with Kylie wearing all sorts of hair styles. The moves for this video is simply classy and slow groove dancing. She's simply amazing and beautiful in this video. The video is based on her album version.Chocolate is a great single. More laid back than her previous BL singles, which is a good thing. Kylie slows down the paste with her Chocolate single, which is something that we all needed. Keep up the good work Kylie!

review/summary: The most avant-garde & classiest of all Kylie's songs/videos
review/text: I first heard this song on MTV one night and saw the video. Man, I thought this can't be Kylie. This was like the classiest video that I've seen from Kylie. To be honest, though I have been her fan since 89 (during her I SHOULD BE SO LUCKY days) I never really quite like most of the videos. To me, they looked kinda cheesy and very tacky, especially from the videos featuring songs from her first two albums.But this CHOCOLATE is superbly made in terms of both the song as well as video. I thought the song sounded kinda "avant-garde"-like. It was very sensual and sexy and oh-boy, do I crave for chocolate! The video on the other hand was pretty c lassy. I've seen the footage from the making of this video. The director and those involved were pretty innovative and extremely creative. Perhaps, they'd added that certain classic French touch. Anyway, call me weird but each time I grab a piece of "sin" (chocolate, ie), I found myself playing Kylie's Chocolate video just to savor its richness. GO FIGURE!Anyway, good job everyone!

review/summary: Great Song, But...
review/text: "Chocolate" was the best song on Ms. Minogue's Body Language album, but this single gives you a truncated version. It's shorter, with some added effects. It looses a lot of the flow which makes the album version so memorable. The bonus track, "City Games" is nothing noteworthy, and the "Chocolate" remixes just further dimishish the orginal song. The live version of "Love At First Sight" is alright, but Kylie is not great to listen to live. On the positive side, the enhanced video is very stylish. That is the only reason to buy this single.

Perhaps if the video allowed you to skip the segments or turn them off like the producer notes in movies, it would be a nicer experience.

What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the "Sing A Long". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know.

review/text: My children get easily bored with this video. I thought it was several episodes of Thomas but it has A LOT of just children and parents talking about Thomas and all. It doesn't keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking. This was my first Thomas video purchase...hopefully the next will have more shows and less talking!

review/summary: All collections are sure to entertain and recommended for public libraries and family collections alike.
review/text: Four DVDs in the "Thomas & Friends" series are sure to delight young viewers ages 2 and up with the exciting adventures of Thomas the Tank Engine and his transportational friends. Each affordably priced DVD features narration by celebrity George Carlin, roughly 40 minutes of short stories, plus another 60 minutes of bonus features such as sing-along songs, DVD games, and character galleries. "A Big Day for Thomas" covers Thomas' adventure when he gets to pull his very own train for the first time; "Trust Thomas & Other Stories" follows Thomas' discovery of a new way to cross a river; "Percy's Ghostly Trick & Other Thomas Stories" is a spooky adventure in which Percy's mischievous trick to make Thomas believe in ghosts backfires when Percy puffs into a big pile of hay. "Thomas & The Special Letter" sets up a conflict with George, a bad-tempered steamroller convinced that roads are more important than rails. Since the many stories on each DVD are so short, they can be shown to young people who have only a few spare minutes, such as right before bedtime, or all at once. All collections are sure to entertain and recommended for public libraries and family collections alike.

review/summary: Just so-so
review/text: This is a DVD with footage of a "Come Out and Meet Thomas" day mixed in between the episodes. Sort fo a promotional piece to be honest. Still decent enough to rent. The DVD extras are limited and not very good. My son seems to like it o kay but it gets pushed aside for more interactive stuff to be found on Sodor Celebration. There is also a ton of toys shown during the "party/interview" footage which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you need to control that sort of thing with your child. Also I for one get annoyed at the interviewes not sure why they just annoy me. This production has the feel of an old VHS video copied to DVD without much added to it. I wouldn't throw it out but I wouldn't buy it either.

review/summary: More than Thomas, Not Geared Toward Children As Much
review/text: I bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories. Turns out there are only ten, which is a typical Thomas DVD. However, between each story, it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas. As I parent, I'm not interested in this, and I know that my 3 year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day. Plus, the sing-along section has one song. One. We have other Thomas videos that has at least 4, and they aren't special DVD's, just normal Thomas collections. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections.

review/summary: Nice compilation, but DVD could be better
review/text: This DVD is the "Commemorative Collector's Edition" of the *10 Years of Thomas & Friends* video that was released in 1999, and comes with a wooden Alfie vehicle by Learning Curve. It includes footage of the "A Day Out with Thomas" event held at the Strasburg Railroad in Pennsylvania, during which children selected their favorite episodes for inclusion in the video.Since the episodes contained in this DVD have been reviewed pretty thoroughly for the VHS version, I won't comment too much on them.Both the image and sound quality on the DVD transfer are fairly good. The DVD programming, however, leaves something to be desired. You cannot skip the logos and ads at the beginning of the DVD, nor forward through Sir Topham Hatt's introduction to the DVD features--at least, not on my DVD player (I was able to skip and fast forward using WinDVD on the PC).The "Bonus Features" are rather unexceptional. The "Build an Engine" game is best suited for young preschoolers: you add parts to Thomas, James, or Toby. The "Sing-Along" doesn't display the song lyrics, like on the "Best of..." DVDs, so singing along can be a challenge if you don't know all the words. The "Read-Along" story seems to be a scanned version of the storybook, and not very interactive, except for clicking on the arrows. The "Character Gallery" consists of brief bios of 16 engines, plus Sir Topham Hatt. And as for the link to the official Thomas website, well, you don't need this DVD to visit the site.Many reviews for the VHS version denigrate the footage from "A Day Out with Thomas," but I actually enjoyed the footage of the Strasburg Railroad and life-sized Thomas. The interviews with children and parents, though, did grow tiresome after a few viewings. However, the "Day Out" footage actually was one reason I bought this DVD, since I planned to take my 2 year-old son to that very event at the Strasburg Railroad. I didn't want my son to be afraid when he saw the actual Thomas steam engine in real life, since it's a lot bigger than his wooden Thomas train!My son enjoys all the episodes, although his attention sometimes flags about halfway through the DVD, so we usually just watch a few episodes (right now, his favorite train DVD is *Big Trains, Little Trains*). It's a pretty good collection of George Carlin era episodes. My son couldn't care less about the narrators at this point, but my favorites have always been Ringo Starr and George Carlin. I used to watch "Shining Time Station" with my younger brothers back in the 80s. George Carlin does a great job characterizing the different engines and people.NARRATOR: George CarlinRUNNING TIME: Approximately 63 min. (plus 60 min.

review/summary: 10 GREAT STORIES ON DVD + SING-A-LONG & A FEW SPECIAL FEATURES = 5 STAR ENTERTAINMENT
review/text: First of all, let me say that I love Thomas the Tank Engine. My 6-year-old son has loved Thomas for 3+ years running and I am very grateful for all the good times the three of us have had. That having been said, this is a compilation VHS. You will not find any new stories on this one. However, it is worth viewing (and getting, if you don't have a big collection) if you have children. We got this as a gift from friends, so having duplicates of the stories was not a big problem with us. Interspersed between the stories is what seems to be an advertisement for the "Day Out With Thomas." It is interesting to watch, but is not informative for one actually thinking about participating in one of the programs.ABOUT THE STORIES:The 10 stories (4 more than the usual offering) featured on the video are as follows:Thomas & Bertie's Great Race: This is one of the formative Thomas stories and is a welcome addition to anyone's collection. This particular episode is referenced in several subsequent episodes.Old Iron: This is a charming story where Edward saves the day. However, this one is frequently recycled on Thomas' compilations. We already have it on at least 3 videos.The Trouble With Mud: Fans of Gordon the Big Blue Engine will appreciate this one. It is included on the Best of Gordon video as well.Terence the Tractor: This is another story which is essential to Thomas lore. Terence and his funny caterpillars save the day when Thomas get stuck in the snow. The song "Don't Judge a Book by its Cover" is based on this one.Percy's Ghostly Trick: This is a cute little story where Percy gets to play a little trick on Thomas.Mavis: This story features the lovely little diesel as well as an always-lovable Toby. Toby has to show impatient Mavis the ropes in this one.Henry the Elephant: The circus is on the Island of Sodor and the engines are always ready to be really useful, even when 5 tons of pachyderm are on the line. This is a charming story which is not on any of our other collections.Percy's Promise: Percy saves the day and does not let axle-deep water put a cramp in his style.James Goes Buzz-Buzz: We also have this episode on the Best of James collection, but it is a good story and features some nice stop-action animation as well as little-seen figures such as the Vicar.All at Sea: Duck wonders about life beyond the horizon in this lovely story. Harold the Helicopter puts aside his usual haughtiness to help him out. I've never seen this one, so it was a treat for my son and I.Thomas' Anthem Grand Finale: A rousing musical way to end a very well-spent hour on the tracks.George Carlin is the narrator for all 10 of the stories and he provides suitable voices for all the characters. I enjoy hearing him, although he is not as lovable as the quirky Ringo Starr.All in all, this video is well worth watching and would be a great way to start a new Thomas lover's collection. Check it out if you get a chance!ABOUT THE DVD:This one is a little short on features, but the transfer is exceptional. Since kids, like mine and perhaps yours too, will want to see this repeatedly, it is comforting to know that unlike the video, this DVD will not wear out as long as we keep the DVD out of harm's way.

review/summary: Not just Thomas stories
review/text: There are ten Thomas & Friends episodes on this 60-minute DVD. These are not just Thomas stories, but a mixture of episodes supposedly picked by children who went to the A Day With Thomas event in Penn. at some point. Preceding each story is a 40-second or so clip from the event, with parents and children commenting on the TV series. You cannot skip these with the skip button; you can fast-forward, but that's a hassle, isn't it? This is why some customers are understandably upset.But my two-year-old actually likes the footage from the event -- set to his favorite T&F; songs -- more than the stories themselves. Most of his favorite episodes are not here, so he ends up only watching the event footage and clapping every time he sees the mock-up Thomas train with all the happy children onboard.If you own few other Thomas videos, I think this is a decent value, with ten episodes that more or less represent the T&F; series. That is, pretty much every episode finds the engines "cross" -- I'm starting to get real sick of that word!

Overall, a wonderful collection of earlier Thomas narrated by George Carlin. The interviews with kids are cute and provide more than just the usual shots of various engines. I find this DVD better than the "Best of" engines ones because of the variety. Plus, my son has no clear favorite and enjoys watching them all.

review/summary: Nice Thomas Sampler
review/text: Marking the 10th Anniversary of Thomas videos (certainly NOT the stories themselves), this sampler covers a fine cross-section of Thomas adventures (though they are presented out of order), musical numbers (all catchy and certain to infect your child's brain along with yours), and interviews with people of all ages visiting "A Day Out With Thomas." I was fortunate enough to catch one of these outings a few years backs, but since I am a parent of a child with a severe developmental disability, I got more of a chance to "experience" the day on the video than I did in person.Anyway, this is a nice hour of Thomas magic and a good introduction to see whether Thomas is right for your child. Highly recommended here.

review/summary: Brilliant "Life in Music" Rescued from the Vaults
review/text: Now that Deutsche Grammophon is part of Universal, we have seen some interesting things happen, and not all of them bad. What I'm referring to in this case is the new "Original Masters" Limited Edition Box Set series. Finally, the classical music world has taken a page out of the jazz reissue handbook -- put out a quality product featuring rare recordings but make its availability limited, and people will snatch it up.Now in its second round of the "Original Masters" box sets, DG has chosen to follow-up on the success of the "Great Conductors of the Century" series. They have just released two glorious 9-disc collections of the performances of conductors Ferenc Fricsay and Igor Markevitch, the vast majority of which have been previously unavailable on CD.This particular set, "A Life in Music," showcases some of the numerous recordings made by the great conductor Ferenc Fricsay for Deutsche Grammophon, many of which have been rare (and expensive) collector's items for years. As the track information is non-existent above, I will try to be of assistance.The first disc contains Beethoven's 1st Symphony (1953) and the Overture and Incidental Music to Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1950) both with the Berlin Philharmonic (BP), and Prokofiev's 1st Symphony with the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (BRSO) from 1954.Disc two features Mahler's Ruckert-Lieder with Maureen Forrester (BRSO, 1958), and Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony (BRSO, 1959).Discs three begins with Respighi's orchestration of Rossini's La Boutique Fantasque (BRSO, 1955) and ends with Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade (BRSO, 1956).Disc four features the great Waltzes, Polkas, Overtures and Marches of the Strauss Family (all with BRSO from 1949-52). Included here are The Blue Danube, Vienna Blood, Musical Joke, Pizzicato-Polka, Die Fledermaus, The Gypsy Baron, Voices of Spring, Roses from the South, Morning Papers, Annen-Polka, Chit-Chat Polka, and the Radzetky March.Disc five focuses on Fricsay as an accompanist with pianist Margrit Weber (and the BRSO). Together they tackle Falla's Nights in the Garden of Spain (1957), Francaix's (1956) and Honegger's (1955) Concertos for Piano, Franck's Symphonic Variations (1957) and Rachmaninov's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini (1960).Disc six shines the spotlight on 20th Century composers. Here we get Von Einem's Zwischenspiel Interlude (1949), Hindemith's Symphonic Dances (1950), Hartmann's 6th Symphony (1955), and Martin's Petite Symphonie Concertante (1950), with Gerty Herzog on piano, Sylvia Kidd on harpsichord and Irmgard Helmis on harp.On discs seven and eight, Fricsay performs a memorable account of Haydn's The Seasons. This is a live recording with the Berlin RSO from 1961 featuring soprano Maria Stader, tenor Ernst Haefliger, bass Josef Greindl and the St. Hedwigs Cathedral Choir, Berlin.The final disc, number nine, wraps things up with "Ferenc Fricsay: A Life Retold," a 57-miunte interview complete with excerpts of memorable performances.Despite the fact that most of these recordings are in mono (only the selections on disc two, and the Paganini Rhapsody are in stereo), the first rate performances more than compensate for any audio shortcomings. Well, I guess the consolidation of the music industry isn't so bad after all, as long as I can look forward to more reissues like Ferenc Fricsay: A Life in Music.

I knew of Ferenc Fricsay (1914-1963) mostly from his recording of Bartok's Piano Concertos 1,2,and 3 with pianist Geza Anda. Fricsay also recorded Mozart's operas "Don Giovanni" and "Die Zauberflote", both with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in the cast for DG; also Beethoven's 9th Symphony; Bartok's "Concerto for Orchestra", and "Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta", all for DG. Fricsay did not live a long time, dying at age 48 from cancer, but he made alot of recordings from 1949 until his death in 1963, many of them sadly hidden in DG's vaults for decades.DG has given the public a great release with this 9 disc set of Fricsay recordings, mostly in mono, but excellent sound. Do not be afraid of the mono sound: it is very clear and balanced, in many cases better than many stereo and even digital recordings made more recently. Included are Beethoven's Symphony 1; Mendelssohn's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" with the vocal duets included; Prokofiev's "Classical" Symphony; Franck's Symphonic variations and Rachmaninoff Paganini Variations with Swiss pianist Margrit Weber; Haydn's "The Seasons" (complete, live performance with Maria Stader, Ernst Haeflinger, and Joseph Greindl); works of Falla, Francaix, Hindemith, Frank Martin, Hartmann, and others. There is a wide variety of music and you will not be disappointed.Most of these recordings are with the RIAS Symphony Orchestra of Berlin, which Fricsay conducted for the majority of his conducting career. The RIAS orchestra was "Radio in the American sector" of Berlin, a part of West Berlin during the 1940s, 50s, and 60s. Some tracks are with the Berlin Philharmonic, others with the Berlin Radio Orchestra. In all cases, the orchestras play very well, responding with great precision to every nuance of Fricsay's direction.I believe Fricsay would have wider recognition had he lived longer. He was roughly a contemporary of Karajan, Solti, Giulini, and Bernstein, and is sadly underrated today. Perhaps this collection will help to boost his reputation with a new generation of music lovers born after his time. Highly recommended.

review/summary: A great conductor's legacy of great performances of music of a wide variety of composers.
review/text: Some two years after Mr. Richman posted his review, I wish only to support his high rating of these masterful performances by one of the greatest conductors of the mid-twentieth century. These recordings are gifts of grace. The fact that this collection remains available is little short of a miracle. And in addition thre is a Fricsay set in the series of "Great Conductors of the 20th Century" also still available. Many other recordings of performances under the baton of Ferenc Fricsay are to be found if one searches under his name on Amazon. His recordings of Verdi's Requiem and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on DG remain among the greatest ever made of either of these two eternal masterpieces.Try the $12.00 2CD "great Conductors" set first. At that price you can't lose. I predict that having heard those recordings you will quickly seek out and purchase "Ferenc Fricsay, A Life in Music." Too expensive? Not at all. It's worth every penny. It's easily worth several months of anyone's budget for buying CDs. And the recorded interview with Fricsay, already ill and seemingly knowing his death is approaching, will inspire you even as it breaks your heart. His death as he approached his 49th birthday was an incalculable loss to the Western classical tradition. Yet we do have the recordings -- go and listen to them!

review/summary: From the workshop of a great conductor: lightness, tradegy and grotesque
review/text: This 9 CD-Box set devoted to the great Hungarian-born conductor Ferenc Fricsay (1914-1963) is a jewel of the `Original Masters' series. It contains many Fricsay rarities not available elsewhere: some items rank among the best versions in the discography of the corresponding pieces. Fricsay had an exclusive contract with Deutsche Grammophon and made a lot of extremely successful studio recordings between 1947 and 1961, most of them done with RIAS/Radio Symphony Orchestra Berlin and Berliner Philharmoniker. The fact that many of them were later removed from the list has nothing to do with their artistic quality: Fricsay's successor with DG, Herr von K, who controlled the market in 1960-1970s, probably did not want any concurrence with his own production.Fricsay's name is firmly associated with BartokBart&oacute;k: Concerto for Orchestra / Fricsayand MozartMozart: Symphonies Nos. 29, 39-41Mozart: Die Entf&uuml;hrung aus dem Serail, though his recordings of Beethoven, Tchaikovsky and Verdi are equally great. This selection offers no pieces by Bartok or Mozart. Neither can you find here any performance with Fricsay's most prominent concert partner, his compatriot Geza Anda (see their seminal recording of Bartok piano concertosBartok: The Piano Concertos / Anda, Fricsay, Radio Symphony Orchestra Berlin). If one listens to music from this set, Fricsay's greatness comes to light from the fact how easily he could adapt to different music styles - from Felix Mendelssohn to Karl Amadeus Hartmann and Sergei Prokofiev, from Johann Strauss's waltzer to Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony. If I were to mention just two features of Fricsay's conducting style, I would mention his astounding rhythmic control and dramatic conceptions. Fricsay's manner changed after an oncological illness in the mid 1950s and his tempi grew more heavily laden. Personally, I find all recordings from this sampler convincing, be they on the light or on the dark side.Mr. Richman already listed the program, so I can only add a few details and subjective impressions. To me, the highest points of the whole set are 1) Mendelssohn's music to the `Midsummer Night's Dream' (CD 1), 2) Tchaikovsky's 6th symphony (CD 2), 3) Rachmaninov's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini (CD 6) 4) Fricsay's autobiography `Erz&auml;hltes Leben' (CD 9). However, I would not like to stay without any other recording from this set, possibly except for Haydn's `Jahreszeiten' (CD 7-8) - but it is one of the very last recordings of the conductor, and is a unique live document.Mendelssohn is really enchanting. I am less touched by the Wedding March, but the scherzos are irresistible - transparent and seductive. The version of Tchaikovsky's 6th symphony included here was recorded by Fricsay in September 1959. It is surely one of the boldest and most powerful accounts of the "Path&eacute;tique" symphony on record - not an imitation or a study in pompous Romantic style, but a personal tragedy felt from within. I know only a few versions which stand a comparison with this one - two variants with Furtwaengler and two other variants with Fricsay - an earlier studio version taken in July 1953 w. Berlin PO and a live recording with the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks taken on 24 Nov 1960 in Muenchen. In the Muenchen versionB&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k: Klavierkonzert Nr. III; Tschaikowsky: Symphony Nr. VIthe first movement of the "Path&eacute;tique" symphony is even more expressive, but the final movement, the horrendous Adagio Lamentoso is better here: the word `better' is not quite appropriate where it refers to two large-scale variants of a life epilogue left by a conductor who already knew his own fate...Rachmaninov Paganini-Rhapsody Op. 43 (rec. 1960) is simply a stunner. I could never imagine that I would be so captured by this work in the absence of a great pianist. Margit Weber engaged by Fricsay here is no Rachmaninov, Moiseiwitsch or Richter, though she is playing fine and produces a nice sound. The main ideas and the driving force come from the conductor: the virtuoso piano part is woven in the overall orchestral textures rather than opposed to it in a manner of XIX century romantic concertos. Of course, this is a modern and a very extremist reading of Rachmaninov's score, which is seen in all devices Fricsay applies to -- sharp syncopated rhythms, marked accents, flexible tempi, unusual timbres from the string and the brass sections, at times percussive effects of the piano itself. Certainly, only a very convinced conductor with an absolute command of XX century music could venture such a risky interpretation: it lies worlds far from Stokowski's standard set together with Rachmaninov (1934)Rachmaninov: Piano Concertos No. 1 & No. 4. A grim smile of a genius. Or of two genii - Rachmaninov and Fricsay.A few tips for those collectionists, who are looking for other Fricsay's recordings on DG and related labels: apart from CDs already mentioned by the fellow reviewers, there is a tremendous studio `Bluebeard's Castle' with Fi-Di and Hertha ToepperBartok: Bluebeard's Castle/Cantata Profana, two amazing accounts of Verdi's RequiemVerdi: Requiem / Ferenc FricsayandGuiseppe Verdi: Messa Da Requiem; Gioacchino Rossini: Stabat Mater(both ones with Maria Stader), a 2CD set with Haydn symphonies, Stravinsky's `Le Sacre du Printemps'Igor Strawinsky: Le Sacre du Printemps, a Dvorak/Smetana/Liszt CD including the best `Vltava' tone poem I know Dvor&aacute;k: Symphonie No. 9 "From the New World"; Smetana: Die Moldau; Liszt: Les Pr&eacute;ludes [Australia], two different but equally impressive versions of Beethoven's 3d Symphony (the late variant can be found inFerenc Fricsay and two stunning opera recordings of Verdi and Wagner - `Rigoletto' Giuseppe Verdi: Rigoletto and `The Flying Dutchman' Wagner: Der fliegende Holl&auml;nder(both with an extraordinary singer, bass-baritone Josef Metternich in the title role).I want to conclude my review by quoting a story told by Fricsay on CD 9 about an older colleague of his, distinguished conductor Leo Blech. After Fricsay got an appointment in Berlin, Leo Blech told him: `I won't go to your concerts. If you are really so great as people say, I'll be disturbed that I cannot reach your level. And if you NOT as great, I'll be annoyed that you don't fit the requirements of your position'.Don't follow the footsteps of Dr. Leo Blech and listen to this CD-set!

review/text: I enjoy classical music, and specifically the works of Fricsay. I found this download to be well done, but the selections of music are a bit limited. However - I am glad to have this in my library. Well worth the money - and Fricsay's talent pleasantly separates him from all others.

review/text: Ripe political satire is experienced in camping Cosmos during 1986 where the apathetic beach campers are more interested in the beauty contest, the closeted gay exercise coach, eating french fries and watching soccer games on the big screen TV than the tirades of a visiting writer along with a frustrated anarchist and his former girlfriend who is also a terrorist sympathizer. The writer gets a pie in his face in a radio interview and the anarchist finally gets a hearing of his propaganda between rounds of a boxing match. Two youngsters fall in love at a sweethearts dance. Of course, the big draw to this film is a brief appearance of late adult film star Lola Ferrari who made the Guinness Book of Records title for having the world's largest breasts. The fantasy scenes featuring her are more attractive than you would expect.

None, and I mean none, of the items protected by APC surge suppression or UPS systems have ever been damaged. I can't say the same for devices "protected" by other manufacturers surge and back-up systems. We've found a winner and we're sticking to it.

review/summary: Easy to Carry
review/text: When you are traveling, often you have two competing problems. One, you need to pack as lightly as possible to avoid outrageous charges. Two, you absolutely need to protect your laptop or other device from iffy power. The APC Personal SurgeArrest 1 Outlet 120V meets both of those needs.This literally plugs into any normal three-prong outlet - and you then plug your own plug into this unit. The unit provides solid grounding and protection for you. Lights illuminate to show you that the system is working. It's about as small as it can get. It's easily portable. And you know you aren't risking your valuable laptop, tablet, or other device to the iffy wiring of the hotel or place you're staying.In addition to the main plug where the PC or other item gets connected, there are also three phone style jacks on the bottom. One is an "in" jack where the building signal goes into the unit. The other two are "out" jacks for both a handset and a laptop connection.Great as something to always have in your luggage, to ensure your valuable electronic items stay protected. I definitely carry one of these with me.

review/text: These are great pants. They are really comfortable and easy to care for. I'm saving money too because I don't have to take these to the dry cleaners. I love the "Individual Fit" waste band. Who wouldn't like pants that fit a larger waste size without making you admit the weight gain by buying the larger size.

review/summary: These are great classic pants
review/text: These pants are really great. They fit well and rarely wrinkle. I like that they are really classic - I can wear them at the office and then I can wear them if I go out later in the evening as well. I have owned a lot of Docker's pants and they all last extremely well.

review/summary: Too Small
review/text: I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. Even with the "stretch" waist band they are tight. So much for an "extra" inch. Beware. Try these in a store before you buy.

review/text: This product earns five stars not just because it is comfortable to wear and looks good but because it is available in more size (inseam) ranges than other Dockers products. And by ordering online one can largely avoid the disappointment of store stock outs.

review/summary: Not the product described
review/text: I ordered these slacks specifically because the description said they had a comfort-fit waistband. I am an ostomy patient and occasionally need that little extra inch the elastic expansion in the waistband gives you. Despite clearly stating that these pants had that comfort-fit waistband, the pants I received did not have it. In all other regards these pants are perfectly fine, They fit well, and are in every other respect exactly what I expected. However, the fact is that they are still not what I ordered and are not as described.

review/summary: Best Dockers for the Money
review/text: The Dockers "individual fit" system works well, in that one can get by without "odd" waist sizes like 33, 35, etc. by ordering even sizes and allowing the system to stretch a bit if it needs to. These pants are very durable, and still look presentable after washing and machine drying. An ironing every so often would probably be useful for "business casual". A good value.

review/text: Vendor shipped quickly. The quality of Dockers products is getting worse with their outsourcing to different countries. I have 5 pair of these pants and they are all manufactured in different countries and the length varies plus or minus 1.5" for the same listed inseam. Plan a few dollars for inseam adjustment if you do not sew.

Even though the stores sell pleated pants doesn't mean you should be wearing them.The only thing the pleats do is add bulk to the waist line area and make you look fat or fatter.Just get the flat front Dockers and do all of us a favor.

review/summary: Mixed feelings
review/text: While the quality of the product is great, like so many wash pants today, there is no room at the waist for making adjustments. The rear seam is extremely tight, and while it can be taken in with difficulty, there is no room for letting out even 1/2 inch. Purchase a size above your waist size, and unless you can do it yourself, be prepared to pay for making these a good fit. Of course, if you don't mind bunching at the waist, you'll be OK.

review/text: Dockers are Dockers, so that's not the problem. Just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon. "Cafe," for example, should be "Coffee." Despite the fact that the image for "Cafe" shows a stone or very light gray color, "Cafe" is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective, but IS misleading: I didn't want brown pants, but that's what I got.

review/text: To often I have made the mistake of ordering from unreliable clothing sellers, but not here. These are real Dockers slacks with real quality. These run true to size and are excellent quality materials for a decent price. I like the pleated slacks myself because after hitting thirty plus most men have a little extra in the handle section. Pleats seem to disguise that nicely. I recommend these because Dockers are great slacks and wear well, and these are true Dockers.CA Luster

For summer wear, you can get a casual yet very classy look if you pair them with a shirt from Van Heusen, DKNY, Pierre Cardin, Geoffrey Beene, Stafford or other such brand. The "individual-fit" waistband automatically expands by one inch for added comfort.

review/summary: Individualism ready-made
review/text: I hate shopping anywhere but online. Pant sizes, however, tend to be so irregular that I've had no choice but to head for a Sears or Kohl's (or Walmart, if it's closer). Finally, a solution: Dockers "Individual Fit." Somehow, Levi has designed a "forgiving" waistband that adjusts to the wearer, allowing the consumer to be off by an inch if not more in his measurements. Moreover, it's not a Sansabelt or half-elastic waistband that's sure to be a badge of geriatric distinction. You won't need AARP membership to feel comfortable about purchasing or wearing these.Add to the above exclusive feature the durabiity of the fabric and the consistency among styles (pleated or straight), and it's not hard to justify spending an extra ten bucks on the brand.

review/text: I have worn these pants for years; my size is the same as always. I couldn't get them on; they were so tight I couldn't get the button buttoned around the waist. What is going on? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old, not someone who is a little on the hefty side. Further, the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight...$16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product. I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all. You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling, and there are "deals" out there from major store chains. I was really disappointed in this product and the seller. Go to WalMart and get their khakis; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron.

It covers a great amount of the analytical chemistry scope, with subjects like: -IDENTIFICATION OF COMPONENTS -QUALITATIVE -QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS, both single and multiple -OPTIMIZATION of strategies -QUALITY ASSURANCE -STRUCTURE ANALYSIS -CHEMOMETRICS

review/summary: A unique, off-the-beaten-path travel guide and planner.
review/text: Unlike most travel guides on Chicago, Bill Franz's Alternative Chicago is designed for readers interested in what Chicago has to offer the visitor regarding counter-culture and neighborhood eccentric attractions. Franz offers a neighborhood-by-neighborhood exploration of hundreds of distinctively Chicago places like &quot;Smuggler's Row&quot;, &quot;Medusa's Circle&quot;, &quot;The Ennui Cafe&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Wax&quot;. This superbly original compendium of addresses, maps, store hours, and telephone numbers will enable the reader to create a truly unique, memorable, off-the-beaten-path trip whether they are an out-of-town newcomer or a long-time denizen and resident.

review/summary: Awful
review/text: Unfortunately I only read the introduction to this book before buying, and it sounded like it was exactly what I was looking for: a book to tell me all the cool places to go in the city that one might not normally find. I'm new to Chicago, and I want to find the places to go off the beaten path.I wish I had skimmed the book before I bought it. In this book, the author reviews places he feels one needs to see. Review after review of restaurants and clubs and stores, the author used descriptions like, "decent" and "nondescript." In one review, he claims he is "a tad ambivalent" about that specific restaurant, and in another, he reviews a bar as being the sort that "you never want to go to but find yourself in anyway." Even the places he talked about positively, he never got excited about them. The most you'll get is a restaurant that serves food that is "quite good." He spends a good chunk of the book talking about how he is an "old man" now, and talks about things he did when he was young and what the neighborhoods of Chicago were like years ago, and in many of his reviews he admits that he hasn't been to that place in some time. This is fine if that's what you are looking for, but I would recommend a book on Chicago history if that's the case. The last straw was a review of a resale shop that ACTUALLY starts out with, "Nothing special." Why include this in your book of places "you want to know about" if it is nothing special? I stopped reading the book after that listing, and it went straight in the trash. Worthless.

review/summary: The Sleeping Boy by Barbara J. Stewart
review/text: Every once in awhile, amazing, complex and believable characters are born - Annie Shannon is one of those characters. Most women can relate to her on some level. A real woman with regrets, who doesn't have to be beautiful, rich or famous to be a central character in a book. I hope she will be a recurring character and that this wonderful new author will bring her back into our lives again and again.Stewart tells a gripping tale that hooked me from the first page to the very last. You get to know Stewart's characters so well that you visualize them clearly without having to be told what they're wearing that day or how they style their hair. She captures the essence of their personalities and makes them so believable that the reader buys into their motivations within the unfolding plot. The plot that unfolds is full of twists and turns keeping the reader guessing to the very last page. A remarkable accomplishment!!I highly recommend this new book - a compelling read. I hope we'll see much more from Barbara J. Stewart.

review/summary: A story that is ... strangly expressed.
review/text: Many people may disagree with me, but I think this book is not suitable for children. The images are taunting and very nicely rendered, however, there are some strong hidden meanings within them. Such as the imagery of soldier and violent, and especially the general's black leather glove (maybe symbolic to the idea of totalism?).What interest me the most is the climax of the story; when the boy and his family falls into sleep, and they wake up when peace finally arrives to the country. I want to know why that symbolizes in the story, what is the author trying to describe or proof to the reader?I think this is a book quite dangerous for parents to read for their kids at bedtime, unless you go further in describing them the history and cross-meanings of the book--perhaps that is complete package of the book, and what the author want every parent or teacher to do.

review/text: Although the images are very well rendered, they arefrightening. I am baffled about the impression this book is supposedto leave on children. This book may be picked up on the thought that it is a retold fairy tale, when it is an abstract and grim retelling of the horrors of WWII in Berlin. The most horrifying image is that of Major Kreig's big black gloves enveloping the body of the little boy. This book is NOT appropriate for younger readers. I can see how this book might be valuable for an alternative look at the war for middle schoolers or higher.

It's wonderful that Leap Frog makes books that go beyond teaching ABC's for kids because there are so many important things they need to learn, and this book has loads of them (bigger vocabulary, comprehension, numbers, shapes to name a few). As a former teacher, I highly recommend this book for the entertainment AND education.

review/summary: Great book for Bob fans...
review/text: This is a great book if you have Bob fans in the house. The only concern that we had with it is that it does teach insecurity through Lofty. Saying things like, "I'm not any good for anything," really doesn't do much for the self esteem in a child. As a teacher, my husband was quite concerned about comments such as those stressed by Lofty throughout the book. We also didn't like hearing Spud saying, "nay, nay nay nay nay" -not something you want to hear repeated by a three-year-old. Anyway, my son loves this book and plays with it throughout the day, almost daily. I just wish I could edit out those things that are insecurities and it would be a great book. Whenever Lofty says that he can't do something, my son says, "yes you can!" So, keep that in mind before buying the book. You're going to have to explain a few things as the story goes along. They really need to make more of these books with characters such as Bob. They're a bunch of fun and the music/voices are the same as the show.

review/summary: An excellent account of daily life during the civil war!
review/text: Publishing this book was a life long dream of my father-in-law, Abbott Spear. He spent much of his life working to make it a reality and unfortunately, he passed away shortly before it was released. The book should be read by those interested in a first hand view of the civil war as seen through the eyes of an ordinary man (2nd in command under Chamberlain). It provides great insight into what daily life was like during the war. I found this book to be extremely moving...it made me proud of as well as grateful to those that lived through conditions most of us could never even imagine.

review/summary: First-Rate Recollections of the Civil War
review/text: John J. Pullen, in his seminal work "The Twentieth Maine" describes Ellis Spear as a determined man with a dry sense of humor, the kind to "take the convervative view of men and events." Ellis Spear, a schoolteacher prior to the war, joined the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a lieutenant in 1862. He would over the course of the Civil War rise to the commissioned rank of Colonel and the brevet rank of Brigadier General, a remarkable performance for a man with no prior military training. His duties with the 20th Maine would take him everywhere the Union Army of the Potomac traveled from late 1862 through Appomattox in 1865. As a Major, Spear was often the day-to-day commander of the 20th after August 1863.The 20th Maine is rather more famous than most volunteer regiments, thanks to its heroic fight on Little Round Top on the second day of the Battle of Gettyburg, a stand dramatized by Jeff Shaara in the novel "Killer Angels" and in the movie "Gettysburg." Spear's recollection of that day varies in the details from the traditional account presented by Pullen but this probably says more about how confusing a battle can be, especially when recollected thirty or forty years later, than about any real contradition in facts."Recollections" actually has three parts: Spear's notes jotted down during the war itself; a first attempt at writing them up in narrative form around 1896, and a more finished attempt undertaken sometime after 1900. The post-1900 attempt is the most readable, and is presented first. It should be read in close conjunction with the end notes to understand the context in which Spear was writing. A comparison with the other versions provides an interesting lesson in historiography.Spear's recollections document the life of the regiment in camp and on campaign. He details the challenges posed by the weather, the terrain, the poor food, the often indifferent leadership, and the Confederates themselves. Spear writes in a matter-of-fact manner, interspersed with the kind of understated dry humor well-known to those who have lived in Down East Maine. His story is a remarkable tribute to the toughness of Civil War volunteers, who soldiered under sometimes appallingly bad conditions with grumpy good humor and perseverence. Spear comes across in this narrative as a dedicated, common sense officer who conscientiously carries out his duties. Spear's gift for observation captures, among other events, some excellent vignettes of the temporary truces established by opposing picket lines, the sometimes strange persistence of good manners in the midst of war, and the inherent brutality of combat.This book is highly recommended to students of the Civil War and to casual readers looking for a sense of the times.

review/summary: The Food of Love
review/text: A tale of tangled relationships and excellent food! Laura is an American student studying in Italy, and has decided to take the advice of her Italian friend and will date only men who can cook. Tommaso and Bruno are friends who both have their eye on the beautiful Laura. Tommaso has lied, convincing her he is a chef and is dating Laura, while Bruno secretly cooks for them and looks on enviously in the background. The situation is bound to get out of control as the deceptions build.This novel is a trip to Rome through smells and flavours. I absolutely loved reading about the food, Anthony Capella describes the aromas, looks, and tastes so well it's as though you're right there in Italy. This is the main attraction of the novel for me, although the plot was interesting as well. Bravo!

review/text: I bought this book for $1 at a Barnes and Noble clearance table. I shelved it for about a year while I read other books. I finally grabbed it off of my bookshelf one day last week after I finished another book and couldn't think of anything else to read. It was worth the wait. I devoured this book in a matter of hours. Yes, it is an easy read, yes, it is not a DEEP book, but it is a fun book that makes me want to visit Italy and savor some REAL Italian food, drink some espresso, eat some gelato and stare at hot Italian men. I am glad to have read a fun romance written by a man. It is easy to tell that it was a male author and it is a welcome change from all of the drama of a female romance novel. The characters were predictable, the plot as well but I am so glad somebody wrote a book just to write something fun and not because of some hidden agenda with a "meaning". This book is worth way more than what I paid for it. It is worth list price and I don't say that often.

Italian cooking is tremendously varied and rich, and this book makes that clear. Read the "Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini" and you'll understand that the French court learned to cook from the Italians.

review/text: I found the book to be light-hearted, fun and relatively fast-moving. True, it was predictable, but that didn't detract from Capella's take on the triad of Bruno, Laura and Tomasso. In fact, it was nice to see how Cappella put his spin on the Cyrano story. The descriptions of the food and the locale enhanced the story and added to the atmosphere, though at times were a "trifle overdone" (pun intended). The only thing that kept me from giving this a 5 was the author's descriptions of the sex scenes which were at times too graphic -- too male, perhaps, like reading Playboy/Penthouse letters -- for my taste. In all, though, the book was entertaining and a fun way to occupy a few summer afternoons.

review/summary: A Scrumptious Romp
review/text: This is a fabulous novel.It's about two young Italians who fall in love with the same American student in Rome. The American's a fox, knows it, and would normally be unattainable, but for the fact that she's a fool for good food. So her handsome but shallow Italian admirer convinces his best friend, a shy and slightly morose chef, to dazzle the woman with some exquisite cooking, for which the callow one takes credit.This the shy chef does, with remarkable results, since he also falls in love with the American woman (gazing from afar), and his suddenly-inspired cooking evokes the full range of emotions that she awakens in his heart.This segment also includes some wonderful discussions of classic Roman cuisine.So...that's the set-up, and the rest of the book does not disappoint.Unfortunately the book starts slowly, with some awkward writing. But if you hang in through the first twenty pages the writing suddenly turns crisp, the pace quickens, the plot takes some delightful and unanticipated turns; and you find yourself at a banquet, savoring a remarkable meal that's about the awakening and refinement of the only appetite that matters.It's tragic that a book this good is already out of print.

I devoured the book (pun intended) from start to finish. It made me appreciate food and its preparation, and we're booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes described.What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food, this does for Italian. There is magic in preparing food for those you love. This is a fable, a romance (in the medieval sense of the word). It's about the magic and wonder of food and love, the sensual beauty of the world.

Tomasso is the good-looking Italian charmer in love with American Laura. He can't cook, but his less good-looking friend Bruno can, so Tomasso uses Bruno's cooking skills to woo Laura. Of course, Bruno is also in love with Laura but she has no idea it's him cooking her all the wonderful meals. The story takes place in Italy with nice descriptions of scenery and food. I like light, chick-lit kinds of books along with serious stuff, and I thought this wasn't stupid or mindless like a lot of romance books. I really enjoyed the first three-quarters of the book, but the last few chapters (and especially the very end) weren't quite as good as the beginning. There were also a few plot twists, such as one involving the Mafia, that I didn't think were necessary. However, I found this book hard to put down and would definitely recommend it.

review/text: This book is better than ANY of the great trashy historical romances I have EVER read. I love to cook; I love to eat; I love my husband. This book made a great week for all three. It was an inspiration for me to perfect a couple of things, cooking and uhmmmm. If you want to get INSPIRED too, then read this book!! I'd pair it with a couple of cooking books, like Cooking in the Nude: the one for newlyweds, Booty Food, Inter-courses, or something like that. Enjoy a great book!

review/text: I enjoyed this book-- it was much better than the standard "chick lit" titles. It was a lightweight story, easy to read, and the Roman food, cooking, markets and people were fun. Didn't mind the creative cursing-- how very true to "Roman young stud" it was! Maybe the Laura character was a bit underdeveloped, but I much prefered to read about Bruno.I liked this book SO MUCH more than "Cooking for Mr. Latte" - it was a fun read.

review/text: Food, especially Italian food, and love. Just the thought makes me drown in the shear yumminess. This is a very fun book, written with wit and sensuality and lovely, lovely longing. While this in no way compromises the joy of a book in which the descriptions of food easily overwhelm not only readers, but the characters as well, those same characters do become ever so slightly tedious late in the book. But read on! There are near-recipes right through to the end. The writer looks forward to further food fables from author Capella, who demonstrates influences from Garcia Marquez, Allende, Esquival, Lily Prior, and Joanne Harris, all of whose readers would readily enjoy this book.

A young chef falls in love with a beautiful blonde American student. His friend a waiter starts to date her. The waiter passes himself off as a chef and asks his chef friend's help in preparing wonderful Italian dishes for the American girl. There's more to the plot. This is a lightweight novel- a beach book. I did want to visit Italy and eat Italian food. My book club's discussion was very short.

I searched everywhere for the book here in the states, and it was sold out everywhere...and to be honest, I am not sure why! All of the characters were not very well depicted, except for Laura. The description of Rome and the other cities the book took place in where not vivid. And the plot very predictible. The addition of the mafia in the story could have also been completely taken out...there was no need for it in the book! I just can't seem to think of anything really good to say about this book...maybe the recepies at the end are good to cook?

review/text: This is one of the worst written books I have ever read.I wish I had saved my money and my time.The book is full of superlatives. Everything is "the best ever experienced" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader. Very inappropriate.Not sure who would really like this book.Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot, story development, characterization or any other facets of literature.Find yourself something with a little more substance, and I think you'll be much happier.

review/summary: Not as good as I Expected
review/text: Unlike the other reviewers, I was disappointed with this book. The author's passion is clearly food -- his writing is at its most vibrant and vivid when he's describing the cooking scenes, or Bruno's hunts at the market for the food he uses to prepare the next meal for Laura... I could almost see/hear/smell the street markets as I read the scenes.Alas, I did not get the same sense about the characters in this book; all seemed wooden -- even cartoonish. Laura, especially. The final meeting between Bruno and Laura came across as too contrived and unbelievable.I also agree with another reviewer, in that I didn't see where the Mafia plot was necessary. In fact, it detracted. As did the whole thing with the chef Alain.Finally, I thought the author overdid it with his numerous Italian swear words and curses. Especially in the beginning of he book, it was almost as though he trotted out every one that he knew just because he knew it. Cussing is like hot sauce -- a little goes a long way.

review/text: This first novel by Anthony Capella is a fresh and sassy romp of a love story. Very Italian, very gourmet, very funny, very sexy, it's a perfectly delightful summer read, a mini holiday in Italia. Witty, satirical in places, sad in other places, but ultimately satisfying, Capella has captured personalities with style and precision. It reminded me of nothing so much as a Shakespearean comedy, not so much in terms of literary value, but with respect to its bawdiness, its charm and its humor. Delicioso and molto buffo! Bravo to the author - can't wait to read his next offering.

review/text: Bruno is not just an Italian cook, who can prepare dishes from typical recipes, he is a chef who gathers ingredients and creates his own masterpieces of flavors. However, he is not confident in other areas of his life, such as love. When his roommate and friend, Tommaso, asks for his help to seduce an American tourist by secretely preparing wonderful meals for her, Bruno doesn't see the harm in agreeing to let Tommaso take the credit. Little does he know that the American woman, Laura, is the same one he has been watching in the local markets. Bruno creates foods that show his feelings, but Laura believes that Tommaso is the chef. What is she really falling for? The food that Bruno passionately prepares or Tommaso?It is a joy for any reader who loves food to read about the dishes that Bruno creates. This was a yummy book because of the delicacies and because of the love story. The author, Anthony Capella, really knows his Italian food! I highly recommend it! It is a great new addition to the food and fiction category.

review/text: She put down the spoon, amazed. It was all gone. She had eaten it without being aware of eating, her mind in a reverie."Did you like it?"She looked up. Somehow she wasn't surprised. "What was it?" she asked."It doesn't have a name," Bruno said. "It's just... it's just the food of love." [Page 255]This romantic comedy, mainly set in Rome, is an enjoyable tale of two Italian men who romance an American student with food. Although a very different story, a part of the theme is reminiscent of "Cyrano de Bergerac."Reading THE FOOD OF LOVE will leave you dreaming about a visit to Italy, a fine Italian meal, perhaps preparing a meal of your own, and the sentiments of romance.I enjoyed every single page of the story. From the moment I picked up the book, if I wasn't chuckling, I had a smile on my face.The vivid description of characters, neighborhood, and locales reminded me of my time in Italy as study-abroad student. Each character was engaging and authentic - from the protagonists to the secondary characters.I loved the restaurant/kitchen scenes; the descriptions of Bruno shopping and cooking; and the scenes of the small Italian town where he found some solace.I got a kick out of the Italian sayings and their translations: Parla comme t'ha fatto mammeta. Translation: Speak as your mother showed you - i.e., Cut the [bull]. [Page 36]. Applied in appropriate segments, they were funny and added to the make up of the characters that used them. I could envision Tomasso and Bruno talking like that.Along with a happy ending, the story finishes with a few simple recipes. Normally, I don't cook, but I was inspired to try making some of the dishes. I'm happy to write that my cooking endeavors were a success.Cleverly written, THE FOOD OF LOVE is a recommended read.Fafa Demasio

review/summary: Gastronomic delights
review/text: For any kind of foodie or to anyone who delights in Italian cuisine, this book is a must. Tommaso is a handsome, very Italian looking young man who attracts girls like flies to honey, but who especially appreciates the charms of blonde, non-Italian females. He works as a waiter at one of Rome's most up market restuarants and shares an apartment with his old friend, Bruno, a rather plain looking man who happens to be a brilliant and inspired chef. Laura is an American art history student, in Rome on a scholarship, determined to follow the advice of her Italian girlfriend to find herself a boyfriend who is a chef, as they're supposed to be "good with their hands". When Laura and Tommaso meet, he introduces himself as a chef and a Cyrano de Bergerac situation occurs with Bruno cooking incredibly wonderful, sensual meals for Laura, for Tommaso to pass off as his own work. It's an engagingly light read, full of descriptions of mouth watering Italian dishes, overlaid with love and laughter, perhaps not for those readers who aren't at all interested in enjoying good food...and there are such people...but for those who enjoy the use of all of their senses, a sheer delight!

review/text: I had just finished reading 'The Food of Love' by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do, but read. Mind you, reading is one of my favorite pastimes.I had recently bought a series of books. The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at Waterstones in London (British's equivalent of Barnes&Noble;). I wasn't really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since.If you love food and a little romance, which I am both fond of, it's an excellent book to read. Mr. Capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured Italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more. This book took me by surprise and I'm sure you would not be disappointed.

review/text: A clich&eacute;d storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the clich&eacute; for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up.

review/text: This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love.It's a lot better when it deals with food than with love. In fact, food is not only a metaphor for love and love-making but seems a more than adequate substitute. People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing.I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot, openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac. The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters. After that, the returns swiftly diminish.Still, for a plane ride, one could do worse I suppose.

review/summary: Cyrano de Bergerac goes to Rome
review/text: I read this last week on a long-haul flight - perfect diversion on a noisy, crowded plane with indifferent plastic airline food!This is a take on the famous Cyrano story where an inarticulate man in love speaks to the love of his life through the only means at his disposal: in this case cooking rather than poetry.Bruno loves Laura who loves Tommaso who really could not give a damn about anyone except himself. Put them all into the kitchen of a Michelin-starred restaurant, throw in a few comic extras (the college teacher with neuroses about food, the barrista determined to brew the best cup of coffee in the universe, "quaint" Mafioso, etc), add in a diversion in the rural depths of Le Marche and you have a very jolly read.If you like food, then you can smell the cooking and taste the flavours as they can only be experienced in Italy. You can walk the back streets, visit the markets and learn about the great Roman love of traditional food.My only criticism is that Laura is perhaps a bit over-drawn: she is too obviously a character created by a man rather than a woman and reminded me a little too much of the much admired Nigella Lawson.I agree with the reviewer who enjoyed the little asides of very rude Italian slang - a guide on what not to say when in Rome!I will most certainly be looking for other books by this most welcome new author.

review/summary: The Case of the Double Murder
review/text: In Chapter 1 Gil Adrian walks into the Oaks Restaurant. Gil has been accused of bribing city and state politicians, and being connected to organized crime. A stranger joins him, and they begin to leave. Suddenly, Gil shoots this stranger and takes off in his black Mercedes. The police are called, and go to Adrian's house. They find Gil's wife outside, enter the house, and find Gil dead in the den from two shots to his head! [Gardner always played down the background corruption in his stories. The idea of a double murder popped into to my mind.] Chapter 2 provides an example of wrongful conviction, which happens more often than the dramas on TV would suggest. This is an omen for Chapter 3, where Mrs. Gil Adrian, the trophy wife, retains Perry Mason. Laurel doesn't know much about Gil's business, or of any powerful enemies. Does the political establishment want to hang the murder on Laurel and thus bury the scandal? Mason learns the stranger Gil shot was unidentified; all he had was cash, a phony driver's license, and a .22 pistol strapped to his ankle. Wasn't a .22 pistol the weapon of choice for hit men asks Mason? Mason contacts David Niles, a Federal prosecutor, and suggests an alliance. [This never happened in the original series, to my recollection.]Chapter 8 tells of the beating that was given to Paul Drake Jr. after he questions Anselmo Costa in Las Vegas. Perry Mason also visits Las Vegas to ask questions, but learns little more. The preliminary hearing in Chapter 19 is as good as Gardner's best. It tells why a defendant shouldn't wear sunglasses. Chapter 20 explains why getting testimony about 'Karl Braundorff' was important. This led to Janet Coleman, a 'roper' (like Raymond Schindler), who told of Gil Adrian's visit to Las Vegas. Then Anselmo Costa is summoned to the witness stand, but he asserts his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Perry Mason gets a clue from the artist drawings on TV. The bank is subpoenaed to find the last check written by Ralph Adrian, Gil's son, before Ralph was murdered. These clues help to solve the puzzle, and Laurel Adrian is freed.This story brings in updated procedures (the defense gets a list of the prosecutor's witnesses), and mentions the terrible traffic in Los Angeles since the 1960s. But the flavor of the original stories has been lost. Paul Drake has retired, and Perry Mason would be an octogenarian, if still alive. What is missing is a younger lawyer, Perry Jr. or Della Mason, to carry on the father's work. This story is like a good reproduction of an old master like Rembrandt, but in a modern setting. It lacks the dedications that were part of the original series.

review/summary: An enjoyable story if you can accept the new style
review/text: The Perry Mason stories by Erle Stanley Gardner were written in such a distinctive style that it is easy to recognize and hard to mimic. Therefore, any fan of Perry Mason will have to accept the disappointment of reading this Mason book by another author of another time. Gardner's style and tone very much that of the thirties and forties, with different terminology and a different level of acceptance regarding how men looked at women.If you are capable of accepting the significant difference in style, then this book can be enjoyed. Some of the characters are changed, for example it is now Paul Drake Jr. doing the investigations and Ray Dallas has replaced Lieutenant Tragg. The hostility between Mason and the police has been replaced by a relationship of mutual respect, within the bounds of their professional rivalry; Ray Dallas and Mason are friends.The story is formulaic of the Mason stories, a man is murdered and his estranged wife is falsely accused of the murder. Mason must piece together a series of sometimes-contradictory clues in order to unmask the guilty and free his client. In true Mason fashion, his questioning of a witness leads to a dramatic courtroom event where the murderer is revealed.Although Gardner wrote many Perry Mason stories and they follow a pattern, there are reasons to always want additional stories. Chastain's effort is a worthy addition to this set, while naturally different, it is still within the bounds of what a Perry Mason story should be.

review/text: Everything you ever wanted to know about management reporting but had no way to ask. The author presents clear, motivated examples of ways to do exactly what the title says: convert mountains of raw data into a few gems of useful information. He presents ways to process data to reveals trends, identify &quot;unusual events&quot;, and to remove the effects of seasonalization from data. But more importantly, he presents approaches for formatting and organizing information so that it is clear and action-oriented. That is, so that instead of looking at a bunch of numbers and going, &quot;Hmm&quot;, your reports are effectively &quot;to-do&quot; lists of things you can act on as a manager.The book is brief, but in this case, more is less. Everything is explained with crystal clarity for both managers and IT folks. If you are designing any kind of management reporting system, either as its user or its software developer, you MUST READ THIS BOOK. Plus, it's short enough that you'll have enough time left over to read the (also short) book &quot;One Page Management&quot; to reinforce this book's points about exception reporting.

review/text: Generally speaking a great book if you are not familiar with management accounting and turning heaps of information into valuable reports for your top management group. No doubt about it: This book will provide the basic tools for keeping your boss happy, especially if you need a brush-up on moving averages, etc. Having vast experience with both advanced financial and non-financial analysis on various aspects of business (shipping and construction), this book was somewhat a let down in terms of ability to inspire and provide ways to improve personal skills to structure and present complex topics in an ordered and clear fashion. A nice bedtable-reader for the pre-MBA. MBAs should look elsewhere.

review/summary: Good reference material
review/text: This is a great book to have next to your "Dictionary of Cultural Literacy" and your "Big Book of Beastly Mispronunciations." It lists several expressions, alphabetically, and includes not not a general explanation and easy to understand pronunciation, but also cultural context as well. There are also several excellent appendices, including polite phrases in several languages, common French ballet terms, and 13 ways to call someone a loser in Yiddish.My only concern is that it is somewhat Eurocentric. This is not too surprising since the majority of foreign words and phrases used in English are European in origin, but still - you can count on one hand the non-European phrases. The only Japanese words included are nisei and sensai, and I would have expected wabi-sabi and umami at least to be included as well. There are no phrases from Native American languages, none from Africa or the Middle East. There is a fair amount of phrases from Hindu and Sanscrit, but since there were introduced to the English language during the British occupation of India, I don't know whether they can really be considered foreign phrases.

review/summary: Just as trashy as garbage music comes...
review/text: I listen to every kind of music in existence, and I always give everything a chance. But now I'm permanently going to start ignoring every CD with a CASH MONEY record label on it. They're CASH MONEY Millionaires, and why? Because they fill a CD with a bunch of horrible songs and repetitive beats. They're millionaires because they repeat the words &quot;huh,&quot; &quot;what,&quot; and &quot;yeah&quot; for every 3 or 4 minute song they make. They're millionaires because people who expect this kind of music to be the next BIG thing make them millionaires. Bottom line: HotBoys are garbage, and so is every other artist signed onto the Cash Money label. I will NEVER consider this good music, and I hope that this is just a passing fad because if this is what &quot;so-called&quot; hip-hop music is coming to...then I only hope it's worth your money cause I ain't gonna spend a penny on it.

review/text: There's a review for this CD that says he likes the Hot Boys but doesnt like this CD. That makes no sense to me. If you like the cash money/no limit style this is probably the best CD you can get. For any fan of any kind of rap this is an essential. This was when BG was in his prime (around the time of Chopper City in The Ghetto, rap's greatest masterpiece) and everything else is good - the other guys, the individual tracks is a good idea they used, there are some good verses where they switch back and forth, the hooks arent too cheesy or annoying and the beats are good.

review/summary: Solid release from Cash Money's prime (3.5/5)
review/text: In 1999, Cash Money Records was releasing music at an incredible rate, and "Guerrilla Warfare" is one of a high volume of long LPs released by the Cash Money Millionaires during this period. While it's certainly not on the level of its contemporary classics like B.G.'sChopper City in the Ghettoand Juvenile's400 Degreez, it's a satisfying album showcasing New Orleans's premier hip hop collective. And this is certainly the album to get if you want to hear the Hot Boys as a group. At this point, Cash Money was at their commercial and creative peak, and they were just embracing their place at the top of hip hop while still years away from any consumer backlash. Rap purists can go on and on about how their unvaried subject matter makes them embarrassments to hip hop, but I'll always enjoy Hot Boys music. What they might lack in pure lyricism, B.G., Turk, Juvenile, and Lil Wayne make up in interesting flows, punchlines, style, and chemistry. There's so much talent in this quartet, they really are a supergroup in every sense of the word. Mannie Fresh's productions are usually the true gem of a Cash Money release, but that's not the case here. Mannie's signature bounce beats with soulful instrumentals and dense soundscapes usually steal the show, but the music is notably understated here, taking a backseat to the talented MCs rather than taking front and center like it might on, say, a Big Tymers release. Each rapper is such a likable individual, and each has so much charisma and talent that it more than carries the album. That said, the album is definitely too long, with a bloated tracklist of 17 tracks running in at just under the CD limit of 80 minutes, and too many songs break the five minute barrier. The production can be a little boring at times, blame it on the fact that Mannie Fresh, despite his musical genius, was the most overworked producer in hip hop history at this point. Overall, "Guerrilla Warfare" is a memorable release that's sure to continue pleasing the Cash Money crowd, like it already has for eight years.After a typically entertaining intro by Big Tymers, the album starts with perhaps Hot Boys' most well known song, "We on Fire." This song embraces the Cash Money braggadocio and extravagance as good as any, and the four MCs show a chemistry and uniqueness that made them stars, over a great Mannie Fresh beat. "Respect My Mind" lyrically is not the most impressive, but as far as style and swagger are concerned, it's great, with a glitzy beat and each rapper displaying their distinctive flow. "Help" has frenetic beats and nice horn instrumentation, Mannie Fresh performs well. "Ridin'" showcases simple production and typical flossing on the part of Hot Boys, it's a solid song, if not a little underwhelming. "Get Out tha Way" has a nice hook, otherwise it's another decent song but not too distinctive. I like "Clear tha Set" for what it is, Lil Wayne's solo, even though it's not absolutely memorable, and I like "I Feel" a little less. "Boys at War" is okay, musically a little boring and too long, this period is the album's weakest point. Juvenile uses a repetitive, conversational flow like in his classic "Ha" on the likable "You Dig," which has some very nice production. The memorable single "I Need a Hot Girl" follows, a Cash Money standard. I think my favorite song is "Tuesday & Thursday," because lyrically it is creative and musically it is excellent, a fine signature styled beat my Mannie Fresh. "Bout Whatever" is pretty nice, and "Shoot 1st" is clever and entertaining, a definite highlight. "Too Hot" closes out the album in representative fashon."Guerrilla Warfare" showcases the strengths and weaknesses of Cash Money and the Hot Boys in top fashion. If you're new to Cash Money music, this might not be the best album to start with, but fans of the rappers should pick this up if they haven't already. This is an uneven yet memorable album, and in many cases one for the collection.

review/summary: Best 4 CMR works...
review/text: Hot Boyz' guerilla warfare is definitely a hot product. But they still sound underground, the production is not on the level of 400 degreez or choppercity in the ghetto. Not that the album is not good, the hot boyz rhyme off each other great but they are just not on the same level as the well produced No Limit CDs (C-Murder, Master P, Sillkk The Shocker). Everything else is great, their lyrics is definitely above NO LIMIT. The production is the main problem, it sounds like some underground No Limit Album like (Tru, Magic 1st 2 albums,Mac and sum old BG albums).Lil Wayne is also a minus onthe album, he was young and his voice mixed with his southern accent is just untoleratable to me, Turk needs 2 appear on more songs instead of Lil Wayne. Juvenile and BG are great, they collaborate perfectly, BIg Tymers really doesnt add on to the album but they dont ruin it either, so its all gravy ya heard meh!?

review/text: it really pains me to see bone thugs loose to the hot boyz for group of the year at the source awards.everybody was pi$$ed over that robbery.i have a lot of respect for southern rap music.but bone had a far superior album then this album.after that i lost all hope in the source awards.this album have a somewhat solid production value from mannie,but honestly the lyrics are kinda boring.and honestly is no where near as raw as older no-limit albums,and definatley far away from tripple 6 mafia albums.

review/summary: Why arent there more like this one!!??
review/text: why dont more rappers do what cash money does? no matter whos album it is, they showcase the best mcs and production they can pull off. there is nothing wrong with other rappers but cash money does this well, while setting asside tracks for the individuals, the group is what really shines, without the bling bling. i promised myself to never to buy the bling bling bull, but after hearing this cd, i had to get it. especially songs like i need a hot girl, and we on fire. get this cd!!!

review/text: This Cd is really good from beginning to end! It has well written lyrics, and phat beats produced by Mannie Fresh. Cash Money is on top of the rap industry. You should buy this Cd if you have Juvenile, or Lil Wayne because it is really worth the money. All of the songs are really cool, but my personal favorites are 2(We On Fire) and 12(I need A Hot Girl). If you buy this Cd I hope you enjoy it!

review/text: The Hot Boys continue their dominance. Yo, if you like what Manny Fresh does with their beats, you'll like this CD. Juvenile, Young Turk, Baby Gangstar, and Lil Wayne all have different styles and come together to make another Platinum album. I didn't give it the five stars because of the lack of other big name artist, and they don't have enough hype tracks. All in all this CD is worth buying.

review/text: ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS WAS A GREAT RELEASE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FOUR, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ TODAY (SEPT. 30, 1999) FOR THE FIRST TIME (NOTE: YES, I KNOW I'M LATE LISTENING TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ) I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MANIE FRESH AND JUVENILE. JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ IS THE BEST CD SINCE SNOOPS'S DOGGYSTYLE AND DRE'S CHRONIC. BUT THIS CD IS NOTHING COMPARED TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ! IF YOU DON'T HAVE 400 DEGREEZ, GO BUY THAT ONE INSTEAD OF THIS!

Juvenille is straight, and Lil Wayne is the tightest in the whole Cash Money label. I was shocked when I heard #9 I Feel. Cash Money think the are taking over the rap industry. Yeah right tight as No Limit is they will always be second to them.

They will beat No Limit Records hands down. No Limit soldiers sound like recruits who had just been drenched in the deep blue sea.There is no doubt that the Hot Boys are the crown prince of the rap game. This album will definitely be nominated as the rap album of the year. Mark my words.So, ponder no further!! Buy this album and I am sure you will not regret.

review/text: This cd is tight. These Boys got mad skills, fat beats and bass lines. The Hot Boys is like a supergroup for rap. All of the members are stars in their own right. BG, Lil' Wayne, Young Turk, and Juvenile tear it up on this joint. The best tracks are HELP, WE ON FIRE, CLEAR THA SET, RIDIN', and BOUT WHATEVER. Don't be fooled by imitators CASH MONEY MEANS BALL TIL YOU FALL!

review/text: This was the first Cash Money CD I got back in March. Didn't really like &quot;we one fire&quot; when I first heard it last year. But once I heard &quot;I need a hotgirl&quot; I had to back track on those hot boys. I had &quot;the wood&quot; soundtrack for a long time and never even played the entire cash money song on that album all the way until then and I was hooked. I just had to get this CD. My favorite tracks 2,11,12,13,14,16,17 but the entire CD is just Off Top!

review/text: I bought this Cd just because young Turk is on it. He is the hottest of the hot boys, lyrically and physically-so cute-! but anyway.. He always has the best verses &quot;what kinda boy whatch jerry springer in a range&quot; and &quot;I like em hot the ones that don't tell me to stop...&quot;. I can't wait till his album Young and Thuggin drops cus its gonna be Hot, even if he raps about the same thing over and over. He's the only reason I like the Hot boys besides lil wayne. But if I buy anymore Cash money CDs it's just gonna be because I wanna hear Turk's verses. Better watch what ya saying whoadie!

It did have some outstanding hot tracks like I need a Hot Girl, Respect my Mind, and Tuesdays and Thursdays but most of the CD was just a bunch of decent tracks nothing that big. If you want to listen to good album by Cash Money get the Big Tymer$ Hood Rich album. That one is much better.

review/summary: them boyz at war
review/text: Lat me start off by say that this isn't 400 degrees. But it is a good investment. It you want an introduction to the cash money millionares, this ids the disc to do it cause their all at their best here. B.G. making everything he says sound dangerous, Turk the lesser known but underrated lyracist, Lil Wayne with his double time (twnty-twin twins, dem-dem, pop-pop, etc.) nothing i sayis a threat voice, and Juvenile...well who cares what he says, cause his southern drwal makes it entertaining anyway.Interstaingly enough, the best track on this disc is the solo Turk joint Bout Whatever, and has me waiting for his album. Too Hot is also reminesant of we on Fire, which is on 400 deegreesTuesday &amp; Thursdays, We On Fire and Ya Dig are also prime cuts. However I Feel and Respect My Mind are the two worst cuts in CMR history. The lyrics are terrible (even for Cash Money) and their is no Fresh beat to hide the. No CMR can be pretty catchy, but leave them out to dry with no beat and no Juve take away from the entertainmen tvalue of the artists.All this talk, and not one mention abou tthe production. If u know CM, you know the drill. So go out and get the disc, yYa Dig

review/text: This is tough to say, but I think this is best hip-hop record since the first Outkast joint. The Cash Money crew all represents on this one, and they are all at the top of their game. I just couldn't believe how good this was when I first got it. I been down with the HB's for a while, but never thought they could drop something like this.Juvy, BG, Lil Wayne and Turk were just amazing. These brothas were having a great time recording this album, you can just tell. The beats are the best I've heard from Mannie Fresh, and the CMR crew spitted those lyrics like never before. And it's same ole reppin' you love to hear from these playboys.Definite must buy, even if you're normally not down with CMR. I'm telling you playboys and playgirls, this album is hot.

review/summary: Fun To Listen To.
review/text: This is the second best Cash Money album I've ever heard next to Juvenile's 400 Degreez which is definetely a 5 Star cd too. The Hot Boys put out an album with like 5 or 6 really strong songs. And as bunch of other average or a little better songs. Not really any horrible songs at all. The Best Songs are the main 4 &quot;I Need A Hot Girl&quot;, &quot;We On Fire&quot;, &quot;Respect My Mind&quot; &amp; &quot;Tuesday &amp; Thursday&quot;. Those 4 songs were the songs I listened to every morning for like months and months. And i have over 200 cd's! So this cd must be good huh? &quot;Ridin'&quot; is another real tight one! Then the other songs all blend in with the rest like &quot;Clear Tha Set&quot; by Lil'Wayne. &quot;Ya Dig&quot; by Juvenile. &quot;Help&quot; by B.G., and &quot;Bout Whatever&quot; by Turk. I Think it's cool that all of them got there own solo songs. &quot;Too Hot&quot; is nice too..along with the rest of the songs. Juvenile, B.G., Turk &amp; Lil'Wayne put out one of the best cd's of '99, and also the best group cd to come out for a long while!It's real good!

review/summary: The Hot Boys &quot;Play The Game Raw&quot; and set it &quot;On Fire&quot;
review/text: I was turned on to the Hot Boys by Juve's Ha (Remix) w/Jay-Z and every Hot Boys' affiliated album I've bought since then has been &quot;Off the heeeze&quot; . The Hot Boys present &quot;Guerilla Warfare&quot;. It starts off with the usual Big Tymers' antics on the intro and ends with the Hot Boys displaying that they will definitely be a force to be reckoned with in hip hop for years to come. &quot;We On Fire '99&quot; has Juve, B.G., Lil Wayne, and Turk trading lines back and forth like they were in jail freestylin'. &quot;Ridin'&quot; and &quot;Get Out Tha Way&quot; has The Hot Boys warning folks what'll happpen if you get caught in the wrong situation. &quot;Respect My Mind&quot; and &quot;Tuesday &amp; Thursday&quot; also display The Hot Boys in true CMB fashion. B.G.'s &quot;Help&quot; also doesn't disappoint. With Mannie Fresh being able to differentiate beats on each album that CMR releases, The Hot Boys, Big Tymers and any other rappers that CMR may sign will be around for a long time. So if you're not ready to keep up with things on the Hot Boys' side of town, you might want to update your resume.

But , on the song &quot;We on Fire,&quot; it was so hot because a lot of whacked-out rap music came out that year and Cash Money came and saved us with Juvenile's song &quot;Ha&quot;.

review/summary: A MUST FOR EVERY PARENT !!!!
review/text: I purchased this book not knowing much about it. Let me tell you...I am sooo glad that I did !!! I am a single parent of a 5 year old little boy who is very stubborn - every conversation and request is a battle. I have felt like all I do is nag and argue with him and can't even remember the last time that we had a "good day". I am very consistent with him and with disciplining, but he still constantly manipulates and argues over everything and it is mentally and physicaly tiring. It has been this way for about a year now and I have been at my wits end. I feel like I have tried every parenting book out there & nothing has worked. UNTIL NOW !! I read this book last week - it was a quick read, about 1 1/2 hours. This book has changed my life and it works !! I love this book because it focuses on only 2 or 3 skills that you can quickly learn and implement. Instead of the typical thick parenting book that is overwhelming and you are not sure where to begin...this book spells it out for you. It gives you DETAILED examples of situations and what to say in these situations. I have only used the techniques for about a week, but it has already changed our lives. My son spent this entire last weekend without arguing with me. I can't remember the last time that happened. We actually were able to spend some great quality time together and were loving and affectionate instead of having a power struggle. My favorite strategies in the book are the "I know" , "Nice try" and "I love you too much to argue". I told all of my friends to buy this book. I can't recommend this book highly enough!!! Thank you Jim Fay - I hope I can meet you to thank you in person someday!!

review/summary: Lovingly letting others experience the consequences of their own actions
review/text: I've given this book to quite a few people. Basically, here's what I got out of this book:It's loving to let your children experience the consequences of their own actions. You WANT your children to become strong, responsibly adults--so you need to let them develop the skills they need to succeed on their own.You also want to do so in a way that is LOVING and not coming across as punishing or the bad guy. It's such a tricky act. But once you learn this (and you'll find it VERY successful) you can apply it to your children, your SPOUSE, and your COWORKERS!

review/summary: Simplified version of Love and Logic
review/text: I am a big fan of Love and Logic and have several of the books already. I enjoy sitting down with a 200+ page book, but not so my husband. I have been trying to get him on board with the Love and Logic program, but he will not sit and read a book for that long! So when I saw this book, I thought it might peak his interest enough to get him to read it. This book is much shorter than some of the others and it thoroughly addresses problems associated with discipline. As with all of their books, there are lots of anecdotal stories with clear examples. He still didn't read the whole book, but he did walk away with a better understanding of the methods used. I found it a breeze to read and it was nice to have all of the discipline techniques in one easy to read book. I also think it is a nice follow up to the Love and Logic books. After using Love and Logic for awhile, I have noticed that sometimes I get a little lax and then discipline issues start to creep up again. I keep this book handy just to remind myself to keep up with the program. It is much easier to quickly skim this short book than break out the original love and logic book and search for discipline. since beginning the program almost 2 years ago, parenting has been a lot more fun! I am also a teacher and these are great strategies! Wonderful supplement or stand alone book for Love and Logic!

review/summary: Don't let the ignorance of the previous reviewer deter you from this valuable resource!
review/text: Not sure what the other reader was talking about. I am an agnostic so I am pretty aware of that kind of thing. I was also a teacher. Not only does Love and Logic work in the classroom but it does amazing things with my kids. I have 2 toddlers and I think the Love and Logic books and videos are an indespensible resource. It seems to me that the previous reviewer was just looking for a forum to rant about something totally unrelated to these books. He also wasn't reviewing this book - I guess some people will actually mislead people to try and get their voice heard. If click on "see my other reviews" under his name you will see that he has reviewed every book in the Love and Logic series with this rhetoric that is based on complete ignorance. Charles Fay and Foster Cline (founders of Love and Logic) are from Evergreen Colorado - not Colorado Springs and have nothing to do with the whole "family first" thing. There is no affiliation whatsoever. Again, not sure what the other reviewer was talking about - but it is a shame that he may turn people away from a resource that is the most effective tool I have come across to raise children who are responsible, able to make choices effectively, have great self-esteem, and to avoid all the arguments and power struggles that come with parenting.

review/summary: A MUST read for any parent
review/text: My daughter is now 14 years of age, starting high school, enrolled in all AP classes, straight 'A' student. A polite, respectful, helpful and caring young lady. I read this book a few years back when we were struggling and when she started to get involved with the wrong crowd. I saw her almost slip away. This book had a great impact on my parenting style and even though I am far from perfect, I applied and still apply a lot of the very simple techniques described in Jim Fays book to my every day parenting. It is a small book, easy read that captures the essence and equips you with all the parenting tools you need! No matter if you are the parent of a toddler or a teenager, this book will be inspiring and helpful. ENJOY.

review/summary: Great Ideas
review/text: I not too long ago learned of the LOVE and LOGIC philosophy and I LOVE it!! I have since gotten my hands on as much of these books that pertain to my family and children as I can!! Jim Fay has really got some great ideas. And they work!! Even if you're not really "In Crisis" with your family or a specific member, this is good to get to 'be prepared'. And maybe if more parents used these ways early on then they would never get to the 'in crisis' stage - wouldn't that be great??!! The idea of this philosophy is to NOT make the parent the Bad Guy for punishing the kid. It puts it back on the kid - WHERE IT BELONGS!! They also have classes on this that you can take at schools taught by other parents and there are seminars by the authors of these books too.

review/summary: &quot;Dinner at Antoine's: An Intriguing Mystery Set in New Orlea
review/text: &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; written by Frances Parkinson Keyes is set in New Orleans during Carnival Season in January 1948. It is a mystery that endures the generations. I first read &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; ten years ago in 1990. I enjoyed the book so much that it inspired me to make a trip to the Crescent City. My love for the book has not died since that first reading.The mystery is terrific. When I began my second read of the book in May 2000, I was quickly swept into the plot. I didn't want to stop reading. The book is so well written that the characters, plot and setting come to life before the reader. As Ruth Avery, the main character, sees New Orleans for the first time, I too saw the city for the first time through her eyes. The author gives a complete picture of New Orleans society in 1948 through the many characters that she develops. Joe Racina and his wife Judith are middle class residents. Joe works as a reporter and Judith maintains their home. Judith has chosen not to hire help as she grew up in Connecticut on a farm. To the opposite extreme you have the Lanlande family at the top of society. Other characters include Russell Aldridge, architect; Vance Perrault, doctor; and Tossie Pride, personal maid. &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; is an old fashion murder mystery that in the style of Agatha Christie is full of suspects. Once again I was intrigued until the end as I remained unsure of the murderer's identity until it was revealed. This book is by far the author's best and it makes you beg for a sequel.The added bonus to &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; are the physical descriptions of landmarks in New Orleans. The descriptions are so great that this book could almost be categorized as a travel essay. When I traveled to New Orleans, I used &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; as my guide. I quickly found Antoine's Restaurant and in the restaurant I found the Rex Room, 1840 Room, and Mystery Room just as the restaurant had been described by the author. The French bread, tomato aspic, oysters Foch, flaming pressed duck with cream and brandy, cherries Jubilee, and caf&eacute; brulot all enticingly described by the author can still be found on the menu. I quickly moved on throughout New Orleans finding the Court of the Two Sisters, Caf&eacute; Du Monde, the French Market, Jackson Square, the cathedral, St. Charles Avenue, the Garden District, Audubon Park, and the Metaire Cemetery. My most recent reading of the book has me wanting to return to discover the River Road and to find out if the Bar None Restaurant exists with its barbecued chicken, onion rings and corn fritters. Even if I find that the River Road and Bar None only exist in the author's imagination, she has so aptly described them that I will always feel as if I have actually visited.Reading &quot;Dinner at Antoine's&quot; is the perfect way to spend a weekend when you want to take a luxurious vacation in the comfort of your home.

review/summary: Entertaining tale of old New Orleans
review/text: Half soap, half Agatha Christie mystery, this story of New Orleans in the late 1940s is a charming and compelling story of love, deception, and murder. Populated by a complex and endearing (or repelling) cast of characters, this is an excellent story. (And why isn't it in print?!)Starting off at the restaurant Antoine's, it follows extremely rich playboy Orson Foxworth (yes, that is his real name) introducing his lovely niece Ruth Avery to the rich'n'famous of New Orleans. Among them are the beautiful Amelie Lalande, a self-absorbed but very lovely widow that Foxworth wants as a lover but is willing to marry; Odile St. Amand, Amelie's daughter, who is suffering from a disease she tries to hide; Leonce St. Amand, Odile's philandering husband; Caresse Lalande, Odile's little sister who is on the brink of a full-fledged affair with Leonce; Vance Perrault, a doctor who cares deeply for Odile; Odile's ex-lover, Sabin Duplessis; Joe Racina, a brilliant journalist, and many many others...After a fateful night where Odile's shaking hands cause her to spill wine on herself (similar to a bloodstain), Amelie refuses Foxworth's proposal as she doesn't want to leave her poor invalid daughter alone, and Leonce attempts a seduction. Motives are abundant when Odile is found dead in her bedroom - shot through the heart with a gift from her ex-lover. Many lives and destinies will change (some for the better, some for worse) before Odile's killer finds justice of a sort...The pace is pleasant and gradual, allowing us excellent insight into the characters. The descriptions of luxurious houses, restaurants and clothing (especially clothing!) are evocative and entertaining. No threads are left untangled, and the question of motive and reason is, frankly, as excellent as that of the Grand Mistress of Mystery, Agatha Christie.There is only one thing that kept this from being a five-star book: As it was written in 1948, this book has a rather stereotyped portrayal of African Americans, especially Odile's loving nurse Tossie. Despite the stereotype, I was pleased that Tossie was not played for laughs and was one of the more insightful characters in the story. The reader automatically connects with her (especially regarding her low, low, LOW opinion of Leonce) and is warmed by the last chapter regarding her.Though Ruth Avery is sort of the heroine, she is nevertheless not the central character. She is strong and independent, with little thought of social position; and, after Odile's murder, so is Caresse (whom I expected to hate but ended up liking). I hated Leonce, was charmed by Orson Foxworth and Joe Racina. I found the character of Amelie Lalande to be highly annoying, with her self-centered artificiality.Though there are a few pitfalls in this book, it is nevertheless an entertaining (and pretty clean as well) story about mystery and passion in New Orleans, a beautiful city. Well worth the read.

review/summary: A Novel as Enjoyable as the Restaurant Antoine's
review/text: If you've ever eaten at the wonderful restaurant Antoine's in the French Quarter of New Orleans (with its many themed Mardi Gras private rooms), you will definitely enjoy this book. And even if you haven't eaten at Antoine's, if you're interested in New Orleans society mid-way through the 20th Century, you'll find this a delightful mystery.In addition, the home of the late author, Frances Parkinson Keyes, is open to the public in New Orleans. It's actually called the Beauregard Keyes House after Confederate General Beauregard who stayed there and Frances Parkinson Keyes. And the author also wrote a novel about the house called "Madame Castel's Lodger," which is filled with the interesting history of General Beauregard.-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller

review/summary: An old friend
review/text: This beautifully written novel in a gently used library copy now joins my little shelf of Unlimited Re-Reads reserved for just such special old friends as The Virginian, Until the Sun Falls, O the Brave Music, A Dance to the Music of Tim, Persuasion and The Final Reflection. The words are worn smooth by familiarity and give the pleasure of fingering a stash of precious stones. Dinner at Antoine's is also touching as a memory of New Orleans in a former time among the privileged classes, with a sunny certainty that nothing will ever change (it is set in January-February 1948).

review/text: Frances Parkinson Keyes wrote many good books. This is a personal favorite. It was also her best-selling book. It combines the color locale of New Orleans with interesting characters, romance, and a mystery. This is the only mystery novel that Keyes wrote, and she does a good job of keeping you guessing. I have read and reread this book over the years, and always enjoy it.

review/summary: Decoy Mystery
review/text: Picked this recently from Grandmother's shelf; she'd never read it, but her few months living in New Orleans were right around the time of the book. It will be hard for enlightened readers to believe that upper /lower classes would behave and communicate in stereotyped ways; umbrage is mis-taken. Not only can you trust an observant outsider resident of New Orleans writing in 1948 to have a perspective on 1948 New Orleans superior in details to that of postmodern criticism, but it's also easily forgotten by outsiders, even after this hurricane, that, in this city more than any other, people lived their lives in one or two neighborhoods. In other words, life itself was, from an educational standpoint, simplistic and regressive. Craving high-mindedness, a fatalistic New Orleanian you never will be. It's faintly surprising that people want it dressed up. This work sure doesn't oblige (attention to fashion and finery notwithstanding). Most of its characters do suit a place so set'n its ways that, even as the book was being written, leadership was passing to the smaller (later giant), more creative city that would eventually come to N.O.'s aid from a few hundred miles to the west.It would be standard (and a bit inaccurate) to say the setting is a character here. However, I will say something you rarely hear: stories exist so that the author has something on which to put the real communication. Forget the mystery. I'm nogood at figuring them out, yet I did. That's not what to read for. I read to soak in the place, the author's devotion to it, and then it just fits that the most humbly local person, the part of the tapestry the astute reader kept expecting to find dirt on, is revealed to have been good all along.

review/summary: Very dated and predictable mystery
review/text: I decided to read this book after a visit to New Orleans when I toured the home of the author. The book was mentioned during the tour as one of her most famous books.I can see why it is out of print. I almost quit reading it after 50 pages. To become classics, books need to have universal qualities that transcend time and place. Dinner at Antoines is filled with stereotypes.As another reviewer pointed out, the depiction of blacks in the novel is condescending and dated. They all talk like characters in "Uncle Remus."The blacks are not the only ones who talk like caricatures. The policeman Murphy talks like an Irish cop from the movies.Other characters also are stereotypes. They are the ruthless businessman (Foxworth), the shallow woman out for his money (Amelie), the noble statesman (Huntington), the philandering husband (Leonce), the flirt (Caresse), Latin beauty (Clarinda), caring old doctor the tough-talking policeman, the rugged archeologist, etc. None of them seemed real to me.The main women characters are interested only in clothes and men. Ruth is a rich 20-something clothes horse with a silver mink coat. Clarinda is considered an old maid at 27. Caresse goes to New York to become a model for a staid department store. None of them seems to have a brain.The plot also seemed a little creaky to me. I figured out "who done it" about half way through the book, even though many characters had a motive and there were clues pointing at several. I also easily figured out who would marry whom at the end.Another plot flaw is tha author does a lot of telling readers about characters and what is going on rather than demonstrating it by action.Most of the plot takes place over a week, yet a murder is comitted and solved, an engagement takes place and is broken and replaced by another, and Ruth agrees to fly to Hondourus marry a man she has known a week.As an example of 1950s race, class, and gender stereotypes taken to an extreme, the book is interesting. It was somewhat entertaining, but totally unbelievable. I did not believe in the world portrayed.That is the main difference between a classic like Agatha Christie's novels and this book. I believe in the worlds Christie creates, though they are set in past times and distant places. However, I feel that Parkinson's New Orleans is an unbelievable place with unbelievable people.

review/summary: The Truth About Homeopathy
review/text: Julian Winston's novel is the most in-depth and informative discussion on homeopathy that I have come across. The book makes good on its claim to insightfully delve into the fundamental philosophy of homeopathy. Also, Winston tackles the important and controversial question of scientific rigor that plagues this medical breakthrough. He makes it systematically clear how the medical philosophy of homeopathy is scientifically rigorous. Also mentioned are the innovative medical thinkers known as the original homoeopaths, the decline of homeopathy at the beginning of the 20th century, and the resurgence of this medical philosophy towards the end of this same century. It is ideal for those readers attempting to gain greater medical recognition of homeopathy or for those just interested in the history of this innovative healthcare technique. If one is looking for in-depth inforamtion on homeopathy that is historical, academic, and interesting, then The Faces of Homeopathy is in my opinion the best book to buy.

review/summary: Among the best technical books I've ever read
review/text: I laid my hands on this book about 3 years ago when I was already an accomplished webmaster. People like me who already know HTML and supporting technologies like CSS will defenitely rue the fact that they didn't lay their hands on this book earlier. Beginners this is the only book you'll need on HTML for a long while.My fundamentals were accumulated as a result of many books on this subject as well as the effort of scanning millions of emails on mailing lists. All in all sheer experience. The author has done it all for you. It's all there in one place, follow this book and you'll end up not making too many mistakes.I often get people asking me about something or the other regarding HTML / client side web development. I always refer them to this book. And no their queries aren't as simple as &quot;What are the params for an anchor tag?&quot;. That any book on HTML can answer. It would be more like &quot;I just can't get this page to have the same gap between two tables. All my code is perfect, I'm at my wits end!&quot;. The answer would be something only an expert can point out, like &quot;Hey you have a newline between your tables in your code. Yes HTML doesn't care about newlines but some browsers do.&quot;Truly this book will answer a lot of questions like that. If you ever are gonna work with HTML or have been working with HTML but haven't read this book, your eyes will be opened either by the fact that you didn't know so many things, or by the fact that a human being could stuff so many facts into a single book.If you are the type who needs a pocket reference maybe you are at the wrong place, but then perhaps you'd demand a pocket reference for building a space craft too! This book is a must for anyone who needs a sense of how web building works.I last encountered this book in 1998 but I just felt like putting it down now, and I still recommend it. There isn't a better book on the subject.

review/summary: Omissions Diminish Usability as Reference
review/text: There are numerous problems with this book as an HTML &quot;reference.&quot;First, an irritation for anyone using this book as a practical reference to look up tag details is that looking up tags is needlessly inefficient. They're supposedly all in the 250-page Appendix A, but to find one you have to go to the Appendix A section in the table of contents at the beginning of this bulky 1100-page tome, look up the page # listed there, then go to that page. The obvious alternative would be phonebook-style page headers showing the first tag name on each page so readers could locate a tag of interest directly. Why wouldn't a tech book publisher have this figured out?The cover says &quot;up-to-date for latest versions&quot; of Netscape and IE without specifying dates or version #'s. The printing date is hidden in the ISBN code. I find this practice questionable.Although pages 7 and 682 say all documents should begin with &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;, this tag does not seem to be fully described anywhere. The syntax suggested on p. 682 (with a single pair of quotes) conflicts with the HTML 4 examples on p. 60.The book cover trumpets &quot;comprehensive&quot; coverage of HTML 4 as well as: &quot;extensive details on Cascading Style Sheets 1 &amp; 2.&quot; One could be forgiven for figuring this means fairly full coverage of CSS. However, the preface draws a distinction between HTML and CSS, speaking of &quot;HTML 4 ... _along with_ new technologies that affect HTML, such as CSS ...&quot; and announces an intention &quot;to do one thing the best I can: cover HTML.&quot; The implicit disclaimer is not idle. Whatever the process that upgraded the previous edition to this one, this book is by no means a comprehensive reference for CSS.

review/text: I should just leave it at that, but I won't. When I got this book I was completly blind to the world of HTML, but now I have mastered it. This book starts off teaching the basics, like how to start your HTML document with the HEAD and BODY tags, and goes all the way into using HTML tables to design your website and using HTML forms. By the end of the book, I knew everything, and was able to move onto more advanced subjects such as PHP or CGI-scripting. This book is the perfect way to get started if you're interested in pursuing a career in web development or application programming. However, if you are not interested in learning HTML, this book is not for you. It is a complete reference and you need to read the entire book to take advantage of it. If you really want to learn HTML then buy this book, because it will be the first and the last you will ever need.

review/summary: Excellent learning and reference book
review/text: I've been using this book for a while now, and I have to say that its one of the best written computer reference books that I've ever had the pleasure to use. Its extremely comprehensive and well organized, with lots of clear examples. It even covers some of the basics of JavaScript and CGI (though you'll still probably want/need another book that covers those topics exclusively, if you're interested in them.)Probably the only real complaint that I would have about the book is that its HUGE. There's some sections in the book that probably could quite easily have been cut or shrunk down. I kind of got the feeling that they wanted to stretch the book out to 1200 pages as a marketting "Look at how huge our book is!" thing. They probably could have made it ~1000 pages rather easily, which would have made the book easier to handle.In addition, some sections of the book are somewhat outdated. That's an unfortunate fact of life with books of this nature, though. Overall, though, the book is still very accurate.

This book has is not just a reference, it has site theory which will open a lot of peoples eyes' whom have already produced web sites in the past. I consider this book more of a course instead of a reference book which one refers to when they need to know a certain tag or command to get what they want. The reason why I gave this book 4 stars, is becuaes this is the only html book I thought was worth buying (esp. compared to other HTML books which ran up to 60 dollars) and have not read any other books on this subject. I would suggest this book to anyone who is interested in Site design....I think the name is wrong when it says html complete reference, it does have an excellent reference section but the material in it is invaluable to any type of site your making and with any type of language/script you are using.

review/text: If you can only have one book on HTML, this is the book to have. No other book I've seen covers HTML and related subjects as well as this one. In addition to HTML, the author covers XHTML, briefly discusses XML, covers basic JavaScript and both CSS (style sheet) specifications as well, in addition to DHTML, which has permeated the Internet.Despite its size and the magnitude of the material presented, the book is logically organized and well thought out, starting from basic and easy material and progressing in difficulty. There are several ways the material could have been organized, and as an experienced HTML writer I would have organized it differently, but I believe the author's organization makes the material more accessible for new and less experienced developers.Any criticisms I may have of this book are very minor compared to the excellent job the author has done with this book, and I would recommend it for anyone who has to write HTML, with or without the aid of an HTML editor.

review/text: There are still some folks around like myself who prefer to design Websites and pages using raw HTML &quot;coding.&quot; Windows Notepad is still my top HTML editor of choice. However, whether folks prefer to &quot;code their own&quot; or use standard HTML editing programs, there are clear advantages of becoming familiar with the basics of HTML programming that will pay dividends in the long run. Not all HTML editors are created equal and sometimes inside knowledge is helpful in the Web development process.HTML: The Complete Reference is a huge 2 1/4 - inch book packed with helpful and important HTML Web design information. Here readers will take in a broad scope of Website programming features that will improve, freshen up, and add functionality to any Website. Learn how to use fonts, colors, backgrounds, frames, tables, layers, style sheets, client-side programming, plug-ins, audio and video clips, and more. Plenty of scripting examples are provided to permit immediate results in the Website design process.This reference book includes all the latest tags, Web browser and programming compatibility considerations, and background information needed to produce outstanding Websites. The book reads better as a reference guide than a novel. However, one can learn quite a bit by simply thumbing through it on a casual basis. A particular Web design feature could leap out from a page and arouse interest that could lead to a great design idea!This book recommended for experienced programmers only, who are well acquainted with the in's and out's of Web design concepts. It's a great reference book to have on hand when a programming matter arises or when some changes must take place to liven things up!

review/summary: HTML made easy
review/text: When I decided I wanted to learn all I could about HTML I went looking for a good book on the subject. I never buy the first thing I see and I spent many hours researching for the best I could find. My search narrowed down to just a few and this book won the toss. I am truly impressed at what I found here. I purchased several books on related topics (javascript and such) and after reading all of them, this book was, by far, the easiest to use. Mr. Powell's writing style allowed me to retain more than I expected I would. I immediately put into use many of these tags to take my website from average to very efficient (and cool if I do say so myself). The reference section allows me to quickly find more about the tag I am trying to use. Don't let the enormous size of this book intimidate you. It reads easy and a great deal of the book is reference relating back to what you learned earlier.If you are using a WYSISYG editor to make your website and want to get past those limitations. This IS the book you want. If you don't buy this book RIGHT NOW, you will someday wish you had. Do it while it's fresh in your head.

review/summary: The Only HTML Text You will Need
review/text: When learning a new subject, I sometimes find it helpful to begin with a Visual Quickstart or Sam's Teach Yourself, then an intermediate text (if needed), and finally an O'Reilly Nutshell or Wrox Professional to deepen understanding and use as a reference.Powell's Complete Reference on HTML performs the task of all three levels.The first 212 pages, "Web Basics," save beginners the need for an "HTML for Dummies." The next 475 pages provide a well-organized presentation of HTML mechanics including presentation, layout, cascading style sheets, client/server side programming, DHTML, XML, and web hosting. Throughout this material, sample code is presented and explained to illustrate the concepts presented. Finally, 430 pages of appendices provide reference level detail that will remain valuable indefinitely.The later chapters (programming, DHTML, XML) are overview in nature. (ASP is discussed in five pages.) This is appropriate, for each of these subjects requires a text of their own. The overviews are valuable as they present these subjects in the context of HTML and how they can work together. They also give the reader a basic platform from which to study in greater detail.Certainly worth mentioning also are the numerous tips and valuable remarks sprinkled throughout the book. In my case there were several one-line statements worth the purchase price.This book is a well-written and thorough text that a beginner can use to learn HTML and an advanced web developer can use as a reference or to polish up. I can't compare this with others books on the subject. It hasn't been necessary to read any.

review/summary: I bought this book after reading these reviews...
review/text: and I have been quite satisfied.Although I don't think a &quot;Complete&quot; reference book on programming, especially HTML, can exist, this is as complete and updated as it gets.Being a professional and advanced programmer I might be tempted to claim this as the best book there is, but for beginners I suggest they start with a book which is more of a &quot;tutorial&quot; than a &quot;reference&quot;. A smaller book that puts more emphasis on &quot;teaching&quot; the basic concepts than providing an extensive reference resource. But after that I strongly suggest they get this book.Remember, no single programming book can ever be a good reference while being a good tutorial. And we need both.

review/summary: A comprehensive and &quot;user-friendly&quot; guide to HTML/DHTML
review/text: &quot;HTML: The Complete Reference, Second Edition&quot;, by Thomas A. PowellOur NST/Engineers company reviewers found this over 1000 page compendium to be an ideal training text and desktop reference for a wide spectrum of web page designers. Individuals working to improve company intranet and extranet communications will be well-served by the examples given of code and scripting followed by what you can expect to see. Professionals seeking guidance in advanced HTML, DHTML, XML, and related internet savvy can expect to increase their understanding of these cutting-edge technologies.We found excellent coverage of the pitfalls of page preparation without knowledge of the differences between popular browser capabilities. The browser versions expected to be in common use for the next few years of Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, WebTV, and a few others, and how to allow for their different interpreting capabilities , is covered throughout the book.Hundreds of pages of appendixes explain what you can and can't do with HTML elements and style sheets. The function, power, and use of Java Script in its several variations are explained with examples. Author Thomas A. Powell, an expert Web consultant and Internet applications teacher at University of California at San Diego, explains the centrality of HTML while predicting changes that XML and other methods may bring in the future. He cites lots of free online Web sites, at all levels, to augment material in the book.We found the writing style, loaded with useful examples and stabs of humor, to be an easy read. This is a body of knowledge that must be understood at higher than an entry level by industrial, academic, and small business practitioners alike who see the need for an effective Web presence.

review/summary: Not Good Enough
review/text: I bought this book based on the Amazon Reviews and after using it I must disagree with the weight of on-line opinion. Not that it is a bad book. It just isn't what the reviews led me to expect. My main disappointment is the poor structure and organization. It has a thrown-together feel, more like a collection of separate and poorly integrated sections than a single well-organized book.Some examples: Even after marking the page edges it is still difficult to find what I want quickly. The text sections are only average and not at all comprehensive. To learn HTML or CSS, you'd be better off getting a book (or books) that is not trying to be everything at once. And the reference sections are also a disappointment. The main headers do not stand out from the repeated subheadings so one becomes lost easily. There is not enough detail on differences between the major browsers. The CSS &quot;reference&quot; is a mess. It is broken into subsections which disrupt the alphabetical order and is sorely lacking in the kind of detail that is critical to successful style-sheet implementation.As I said, it's not a bad book. It's just not good enough. For total newbies, Castro's QuickStart Guide is far superior. On CSS, try O'Reilly's &quot;definitive&quot; guide. Not sure what to recommend as an HTML reference. I'm going to try Goodman's &quot;Dynamic HTML.&quot;

My main job was to layout HTML pages for companies including GE and Sherwin Williams. I found this book indispensable. This book is great for a beginner and a superb reference for an HTML guru. The tutorials are great and the appendixes are wonderful. Although, the only HTML book you will need; you will need other books to cover topics such as CSS, JavaScript, and XML. The book gives you only a brief introduction to these branches of web development. If you use or want to use HTML buy this book!

review/summary: Real HTML for people who build sites for a living
review/text: This book is simply great! If you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize HTML and present its syntax willy-nilly. This book is the ONLY book I've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI, CSS, etc. at the same time. The only thing I wish is that this guy would write a JavaScript or DHTML book. I'd buy that right away.

review/summary: Not as good as the 2nd Edition
review/text: This is a great book but I didn't think it was as good as the previous edition.Firstly I found a few too many errors that would trip up beginners to HTML/CSS. I checked the errata section of the website but not a single error in the book was listed there (at the time of writing this). I can't believe they are unaware of them, especially as this book has been out for several months now.Secondly the author keeps plugging his other book, so much so that he includes an entire chapter from that book here. Although it may of had some relevance I don't think it should of been added, as in my opinion it was clearly intended as a promotion of his other publication. I certainly don't object to being made aware of an authors publications, for instance in a list at the end of the book, but not like this.On the plus side this book does cover HTML exceptionally well, all the expected stuff like frames, tables, layers, forms, links, media types etc are explored. XHTML is also covered but don't expect much, the differences are only in the rules of writing the language, which are explained. Note that there isn't a chapter dedicated to XHTML but you are made aware of the differences between HTML mark-up and XHTML mark-up when necessary.Like previous editions this book does cover a lot of theory, e.g. logical versus physical mark-up, protocols, mime types, parsed html etc.There is also a chapter dedicated to CSS1 and CSS2 which is pretty complete. The CSS2 section includes coverage on the various new pseudo elements and selectors introduced in CSS2. There is also a reference section covering CSS1 and CSS2 at the back of the book, and it includes proprietary properties for Internet Explorer.SSI is also covered in this book. There are also very basic introductions to XML, JavaScript, server side technologies and DHTML. These are more about what they can do as opposed to teaching you them.The reference section has been organised alphabetically this time, so it is much easier to use than previous editions. They include coverage of XHTML, additions to WebTV, JavaScript event handlers and the usual HTML stuff. There are also reference sections for colour codes and character entities.Finally this is the first Complete Reference book I have purchased that didn't fall apart, so there is no need to buy a binder this time around.

Every tag you can think of is thoroughly documented, listing information on how each attribute is used, which browsers they work in, and any special issues. Every single time I have had problems with a tag, I have been able to open the book and find the answers I need. The tag section alone is worth the price of the book.

review/summary: Handy, but has redundancy
review/text: One of the flaws of this book is that the author has to make every point two times. For example, the structure of an Internet Protocol address is covered twice in two separate sections, for a total of 10+ pages. I find that addressing has been adequately covered in other HTML books in 2-3 pages. As another example, the author mentions a trick of prefetching an image by rendering it with a height of 1 and width of 1. This trick is mentioned in full detail (paragraphs) twice in two seperate sections.The author seems to feel that every chapter should be complete in that it covers all tricks. For a reader who reads several chapters at a time, sections become redundant. I agree with the reviewer who said that the book could have been shortened ~100 pages with no loss of value or continuity.

review/text: This book should rapidly become a standard reference work for anyone working with HTML. Given that the World Wide Web is something of a moveable feast, and given that HTML will probably be very different in ten years time, nevertheless Thomas Powell has put together a superb manual that presents information in a clear and concise fashion. His writing style is clear and articulate without the verbosity that is sometimes associated with what is, after all, a potentially complex subject. Information is easy to find and well indexed and the examples are copious. Mr Powell is also to be congratulated for creating a work that should appeal to beginner and expert alike. In short, just about the best work on HTML around - I just wish I'd bought the hard-back version as my copy is looking decidedly tatty because of the use it gets!

review/text: This book was the first HTML book I ever purchased, and unless a change is made to the language, will be the only one I ever need. I was a newcomer to raw HTML coding before I bought this book, and it has proven to be an invaluable learning tool and reference. The coverage of the language is excellent, and the section on Style Sheets is very in-depth. Also, the appendicies at the end of the book contain complete information on every HTML tag and their associated attributes for quick look-up.Although this book can be a little difficult to get started, once you get past the introductory chapters and into the section on actual HTML code it is very straighforward. It provides many code examples along with the results produced, which in my opinion is one of the best ways to teach any language.I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn HTML as a hobby or for business - it covers everything you will need to know.

review/summary: Good Overview
review/text: This book is good in the sense that it introduces HTML and HTML commands. The biggest flaw in this book, however, is the lack of emphasis on XHTML. The cover boasts that it includes full XHTML within it; however, it is really only one chapter out of the whole book. As someone who likes to keep up with the W3C standards and current technology on web pages, I have found that out of this entire book, I really only use chapter 13 which is on style sheets. I read the book and got to this chapter only to realize that everything I had just read wasn't information I could use.This book also includes an introduction to other aspects of HTML such as JavaScript and Server Side Programming, as well as, web maintenance. However, it only serves as an introduction and points the reader to other books. This book is great as an overview, but it does a poor job at helping you move from reading about HTML to actually doing the current HTML you would see on your favorite website.I would recommend finding a book on CSS and XHTML that gives a short introduction to the basics of HTML and then gives more emphasis on the current technology being used.

review/summary: Not a horrible place to start.
review/text: I actually bought and read the &quot;The Complete Reference HTML second edition&quot;.I'm sure they are similar with some slight additions explaining some newer browser compatibility issues and possible additions to HTML and the use of style sheets.The Second Edition was literally a bad book. My copy broke down and all the pages were falling out in clumps of about 50 pages making it tough to use.But the content of the book is simple. All or most of HTML uses, concepts and tags are explained one by one in a comprehensive manual-type book.Not a great Tutorial type book. Not really for beginners. This is definitly a great reference though. For those who know how to use HTML but need to &quot;checkup&quot; on some things sometimes this book is for them.

review/summary: The only HTML book you'll need
review/text: My first &quot;The Complete Reference&quot; book was for Java 1.0. I was so happy with that book that when I went looking for an HTML manual, the first one I looked at was this one. And it's a good thing I did, because it's the only book I ever need to look at for a reference. It really does contain everything I can think I would need to write HTML code at any level of complexity or depth, and I've been writing HTML code since 1994, professionally since around 1997. If you're a beginner, the book spends some time in the beginning teaching you the basics and concepts, everything you should need to get started on your first pages. And if you're a novice or expert, the book will scale to your level of knowledge gracefully, it covers the gamut, even extending into Cascading Style Sheets, Dynamic HTML and a brief introduction to XML (if you need an XML manual you should get one dedicated only to XML, this reference is not complete for that purpose). The title couldn't be more appropriate, as inside the book, there is a complete reference of every single valid HTML tag and attribute you could use, even including explanations for what each attribute means! If you get just one HTML book, get this one.Keep in mind that this book does not cover any WYSIWYG tools for creating HTML pages (such as FrontPage or Dreamweaver). This is just for writing the HTML yourself with a text editor, or to assist you in using the WYSIWYG tool of your choice, as most of them allow you to manipulate the HTML and attributes manually.

review/summary: Simply awesome
review/text: This book is just spectacular!I have been a web developer for several years now, and I have read many books about HTML and related subjects. This book covers it all. But not only does the author cover HTML extensively, but he also covers XML, XHTML, CSS (extensively), CSS2, JavaScript, CGI, SSI, ASP, Coldfusion, and fonts.Many examples are given in both code and URL, discussion, and the thoroughness of the author's coverage, makes this a first-rate book, in my opinion.Most remarkably, the author discusses this subject matter very simply and in a way that anyone can understand (probably). I've honestly never read a technical book as lucid as this one. I highly recommend it!If that was not enough, the book contains about 500 pages of appendices, covering extensively every topic related to web development that one might need. I'm not saying you won't need any other books to make fabulous web pages, but this book is amazingly comprehensive. The author's web site is nice too.

review/summary: The only HTML book you'll ever need.
review/text: The first thing you'll notice about this book is its size, over 1000 pages for HTML, a bit much I first thought. However only the first few hundred pages cover HTML, and it's covered extremely well to. If you have read any other book on HTML then you won't believe just how much has been missed out until you read this book. HTML is much bigger than you would have ever thought.The book teaches you a lot of theory, areas such as logical and physical structure, doctype definitions, media types, encoding types (to name but a few) are explored, and the usual tutorials on tables, frames, linking, image maps, graphics, meta tags etc are all there, but more information is provided.There is also a chapter dedicated to style sheets which covers both CSS1 and CSS2. As HTML 4.0 encourages you to use style sheets instead of standard HTML, it was good to see this chapter. This was my first exposure to CSS and I'm very confident using it now. I don't believe you will have to buy an additional book on CSS.Other chapters include introductions to other technologies like JavaScript, server side programming, XML and DHTML, but these are only basic introductions, do not expect to learn these technologies from those chapters, they just give you a taste.The remainder of the book consists of the reference sections. These throughly cover (among other things) HTML and CSS. The HTML section includes additional tags and attributes specific to each browser, including those for webTv. Character encoding is also covered.I have only two criticisms of this book. Firstly it falls apart in your hands, so if you buy it expect to buy a binder as well. Secondly although the reference section is full and complete it isn't laid out very well.To sum up this book is both a tutorial and a reference and is always on my desk.I also own the third edition of this book but I don't think it is as good as this edition.

review/summary: Good but not Great reference Book
review/text: After looking over many reviews of HTML references, I bought this one. While I'm not diappointed I don't think it lives up to all of the 5 star ratings. Perhaps if you are considering constructing elaborate sites with CSS styles,etc this is a great book. It cetainly gives one an overview of the web but seems frequently light on examples for many of the most frequently used items. If you are trying to learn enough to tweak existing simple sites (my objective) then there is a lot of unnecessary stuff. I have to admit that the tone bothered me as well; it seems the author complained constantly that the web designers were not using HTML &quot;properly&quot; - too many workarounds, etc. Real life doesn't always conform with intent!I use the book as a reference but have found it easier to learn things from on-line sources and real life code.

review/summary: Minimalist Composition At Its Best!
review/text: It may not be the world's most critically acclaimed video game for the Sega Dreamcast (despite having some of the most superbly lush graphics of any DC game and having the same art direction staff as Atlus' critically acclaimed Persona series), but the smoothness of its graphics (something that seems to be lacking from 1st person shooters) and its beautiful music completely make up for it and make this album worth every penny. Rather than most film or video game sountracks, Maken X sets itself apart by utilizing numerous styles of music, from hard rock to techno to East-Indian chanting, no breed of melody is left out. Yes, it does cost quite a pretty penny, but when one considers the fact that not only does it encompass several different genres of music, but also that it has at least four prime examples of each genre it represents. The disc contains a whopping 44 tracks, with certain pieces being as short as thirty seconds, to some as long as three to four minutes! So even if you've never played the game, or played the game and did not think all that highly of it, you are bound to enjoy at least half of the tracks presented on this fine album. My personal favorite track is number 18, &quot;MIST&quot;.

review/summary: Why is there a Cosmic Decoy?
review/text: Book # 21 of this Space Opera is the beginning of a huge story arc, which concludes in Book # 41, "The Earth Dies".These mega-stories are called "bands" in the original German. This band deals with the first true encounter between the fledgling fleet of Terra and the might of the galactic empire.In "The Cosmic Decoy" we are reunited with Cadet Julian Tifflor, whom we met in the Mutant Master trilogy of stories. Cadet Tifflor is chosen by Perry Rhodan to become a Cosmic Decoy. At least four of the ships of the Terranian fleet have disappeared, and Rhodan wants to know where they went.In just the first book, we discover that the four missing ships were stolen by the Springers, a race of space-faring traders with no morals other than their own. Julian is prepared for this mission with a "secret" message - and a hidden special transmitter that is only capable of being received by people with telepathic powers, such as several members of Rhodan's Mutant Corps. Even Tifflor is unaware that he is a living psychic transmitter. According to plan, Tifflor is kidnapped by the Springers, but he is whisked away to a secret base before Rhodan and his men can catch up. We meet a few of the Springers and begin the process via which Rhodan plans to make the universe believe that the Earth has been destroyed.Next episode - Number 23 - "Fleet of the Springers".I've never been this impressed by a series. I'm reminded of old cliffhanger serials like "Buck Rodgers" or "Flash Gordon" when reading these marvelous books. This series is still being published in Germany and is now well over 2,000 stories. It's too bad American publishers stopped after only about 120 books. I had to learn to speak, read, and write German in order to continue reading Perry Rhodan.This book contains another editorial, another science fiction movie section, and another letters column. There are also extra stories - one continuing adventure, similar to a serial, and some "Shock Shorts" - continuing a series of SF short stories at the end of each book. Although these stories have nothing to do with Perry Rhodan, they are worth looking at.It's well worth reading the entire Rhodan series.

review/summary: An Essential Book on Soviet Cinema
review/text: Anyone who wants to understand the movies of the Soviet Union should start with this book. It is very thorough and written in a lively, bright style that is free of academic jargon.Kenez begins with the pre-Revolutionary film industry and shows how it broke down and was built back up by the Soviets. He pays equal attention to the &quot;high art&quot; films that were famous in the West for decades (those of Eisenstein and Pudovkin) and the entertainment films that attracted the average Soviet citizen (such as the musical comedies of the 1930s, like &quot;Volga-Volga.&quot;) He shows how Soviet movies responded to the imposition of Socialist Realism, World War II, and the cultural freeze of the late Stalin era.The only problem with this book is that it is TOO SHORT. Upon reaching the end, the reader wants to see Kenez tackle the films of the Khrushchev Thaw and the Brezhnev era. However, one should be thankful for what one has, and in this volume, one has a truly indispensible book.

Her songs are romantic, emotional piano ballads sung in Japanese. Every track is heart warming -- or heart BREAKING, sometimes it is hard to tell. I'm not sure if my heart is breaking or filled with joy. The playing and singing is so good, you do not have to understand Japanese to feel the emotional effect. Her voice is like an angel.This is a great album from a great artist.

review/summary: A multicultural, multigenerational story of acceptance
review/text: This is the story of three friends and their families. This trio consists of "multicultural rejects"; Justin "Jay" is the gay child of Chinese immigrants; Tien Ho, conceived out-of-wedlock during the Vietnamese War by a Vietnamese mother and African-American GI father; and Gibbo, a chubby, white, socially inept Australian who yearns to be Asain. Each character feels out of place in society and clings to each other only to find that they are even out of place with each other.After drifting apart for a few years, their parents take action to bring them together. They orchestrate a dinner to celebrate the life of Princess Diana and watch the live coverage of her funeral. During the course of the dinner, Justin is outed, Tien's fiance is knocked unconscious, everyone is ashamed when it occurs to them that they forgot Gibbo's birthday. And to top it off, the food is awful!Despite this disastrous dinner, it sets a series of events in motion to reconcile not only the three friends, but the families. In the worst of times, Justin's in a coma, Tien is getting divorced, and Gibbo is accused of being a stalker, they all come together to support each other.This book is captivating from the start and is wonderfully written. The author takes you on a journey with each character, bringing depth and perspective to the series of events. I came away from this book having learned something about people, life and relationships. For instance:Tien's mother, Lihn, in love with a black American solider, is rejected by her family for her love. In a letter to her father, she quotes a Vietnamese author I'd never heard of before, Nguyen Du:"It blows one day & rains the nextHow often does chance favor us in the Spring?If you ignore and scorn my desperate loveyou'll hurt me- yet what will it profit you?"The Tale of KieuThis passage struck me as relevant to my own life as many of my friends are in the stage of life where they are deciding who to spend the rest of their lives with. Not everyone is making good choices, in my opinion, and it's always difficult to know when you should speak up to prevent disaster and when to let people make their own mistakes. There were other passages and messages in this book that were thought provoking and had me reflecting on my life.As good of a book as this was, I still have to give it an overall rating of a 4-stars because of the ending. It was a little too....... happily ever after, for my taste.

review/summary: Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places
review/text: Hsu-Ming Teo's novel was published in Australia in 2005 and released in the US this year. It is basically a story about three friends with multi-cultural backgrounds. Justin Cheong is a Chinese-Australian who is the picture-perfect son. His world becomes increasingly unstable as he comes to terms with his attraction to other men. Tien is the child of a Vietnamese woman and an African-American soldier. Living with her aunt and uncle in Australia, she straddles worlds of identity between Asian culture, Australian culture and wondering about her American father. Gibbo is a Caucasian Australian whose culture serves as a foil to the Asian. Overweight, Gibbo lacks confidence. He bonds with Justin & Tien as outcasts.Teo sets up the classic "No Exit" triangle where Justin loves Gibbo, Gibbo loves Tien, and Tien loves Justin. After the elementary to high school years, the friends draw apart. Justin goes camping with Gibbo with unfortunate results. Tien goes to prom with Gibbo with unfortunate results. The novel reunites them toward the end of college @ the Dead Diana Dinner (DDD) where relatives gather to morn the loss of the British princess and watch her funeral on TV. Here, the parents begin to take center stage and we go through their history. Gibbo's mom has been like a mother to Tien, but backs off when Tien's mother Linh finally arrives in Australia from Vietnam, via a Malaysian refugee camp. Gibbo's dad is a brusque medical doctor who gets upset with Justin's dad Tek and spills the beans about Justin's sexual orientation. Meanwhile, everyone has forgotten that this is also the meek Gibbo's 21st birthday. Tien plans to announce her engagement to Stanley, but Gibbo's mom knocks him out thinking she's caught an intruder.From the DDD, the novels spends several chapter in flashback as we learn all about Linh's history and her love affair with American GI Bucky. We also flash forward to see Tien in San Francisco with her husband Stanley and follow them through his modern art phase and Tien's flirtation with a new age feminist group that enjoys giving themselves haircuts in private places. Justin's life resembles that country song, "Looking for love in all the wrong places." Meanwhile, Gibbo develops an unwelcome attachment to Linh.This episodic novel sounds a bit melodramatic, but reads well. The characters are distinct and interesting, although none are perfect. Teo tries wax philosophical about the weaving of relationships into a lifetime pattern. For me, the Asian cultural self-analysis was interesting as people from various cultural backgrounds try to establish their own roots. Enjoy!

review/summary: An orchestral reiteration of Uematsu's finest work
review/text: For all of those who didn't like this soundtrack or who didn't give it a full five stars for its quality, I'm writing this review. Let me just say that a true lover of "classical" or movie music should truly enjoy this soundtrack all by itself; and for those who are not only among that order but who've had these tunes running in their head for years ever since they first played the game itself, this is a must-have item. Upon first hearing the orchestral versions of these songs via Napster MP3, I was blown away: Those beautiful layers of mellow strings and dazzling piano and every other orchestral instrument make it all worthwhile. It's simply a more refined and mature interpretation of the music that's just fantastic to hear. One might say it's almost like turning your favorite pop into a beautifully blended wine. My one favorite song had originally been the Aria, but sadly, the reworked "Kefka" was just plain gorgeous; the two are now in close competition. I only wish the lot of you could preview the music on the website through RealAudio to judge for yourself more precisely. Apparently, it's not popular enough for that! Needless to say, get this soundtrack if you don't have it already: it's worth it.

This CD, then, takes Uematsu's wonderful compositions and brings them even further from the confines of the SNES cartridge. Yeah, I loved the music in the game, but I also love these versions. The full range of emotion and beauty in the music is realized through the orchestration, rather than what was managed with the nintendo system. Either way, however, you can't go wrong!! I'd pick this up if I didn't have it.

review/summary: Utterly fails to reach it's massive potential
review/text: I think the title says it all quite succinctly at least in regards to the overall quality of the arrangements. There are only a small handful of exceptions, and admittedly those exceptions meet my expectations of what a re-orchestrated soundtrack to Final Fantasy 6 could and should be.If this were to ever be improved upon I would suggest adding in Locke/Rachel's Theme, Cyan's Theme, the Figaro Anthem, Jidoor, as well as the Town of Ruin, and re-orchestrating Kefka, & the Doom Train & the Town 1 theme, and then give us the entire Dream Oath Opera not just the Aria.This is a soundtrack that deserves more care, because it's capable of being the best neo-classical symphony available.1: Opening Theme: TinaThe CD really does start off on an amazingly high note. This is what the entire CD should be and this is an absolute must have song for a re-orchestrated FF6 Soundtrack. It dramatically captures every element of that classic opening sequence in Final Fantasy 6. It's dark and ominous and yet serene and beautiful at the same time. It evokes images of beauty and peaceful tranquility while threatening potential danger, and hints at a driven purpose to protect that beauty and tranquility. It sounds of everything the opening scenes of Final Fantasy 6 portray.Grade: A+2: Cefca (I'm sorry but as a student of the SNES FF3 this will always be Kefka to me)This is the first of many colossal disappointments on this soundtrack. The original version of this song, was humorous and sinister, fun, but psychopathicly evil. You have to understand this guy is dressed throughout the game as a freakin clown! Kefka was a textbook psychopath. He was a person with an antisocial personality disorder, manifested in aggressive, perverted, criminal, and amoral behavior without empathy or remorse. That's a quote from the online dictionary and that's exactly what he was, dressed in a clown suit, and he thought everything he did was hilarious. He's the adult version of the boy that pulls wings off flies and then tosses them into a spider web and burns them with a magnifying glass while it gets attacked by the spider. His OST theme song was childlike and fun in its melody at times, then raging with sinister intent. The version given to us here is immediately in your face with its evil, and follows with a dark and brooding arrangement of the original theme, and never once captures the childlike fun and humor that made the original track one of the best OST themes from the entire Final Fantasy series. It is a neat version of the song, but falls miserably short of it's potential.Grade: D+3: Mystic ForestThis is another great choice for a song to be included on a Final Fantasy 6 re-orchestrated soundtrack. However it's so over embellished upon, and so over dramatized that the "mystic" feel to this forest anthem is almost completely gone, had it not been for the background vocals fading in and out of the melody it would have had none of the original songs feel. This song is so slow, that when coupled with the overly long intro to the actual theme of this song it just falls into the realm of boring and bland.Grade: C-4: GauThis is one theme I had completely overlooked on the OST, and never thought of as anything special, until I heard this re-orchestrated version. Another one of the great high points to this soundtrack, this track is a vast improvement on an nice, but otherwise unremarkable track from the OST. This version, like the OST rather failed to capture the essence of the character, but did however manage capture a magnificent musical beauty all it's own. It mostly stays true to the original song just like the other songs on this soundtrack that are so great. And while it also embellishes here and there it never strays far from the original melody and in fact enhances it very nice. At over 5 minutes long it feels incredibly short, not because it barely touches upon the original melodies of the song, but because it's so enjoyable to listen to that even after 5 minutes you're still left wanting more. A great surprise track and one of Uematsu's best.Grade: A-5: Milan de ChocoboThe chocobo theme is a recurring theme to all the Final Fantasy games, and always (with this one exception) a very upbeat, fast paced, and fun song to listen to. The attempt is to give this re-orchestrated version a pastoral feel, however it sounds to me as if they just overdosed the chocobo on depressants and then kicked it off a cliff. Sure here and there the song soars beautifully, just as if the bird decided to flap its wings and fly, but then it goes right back into that depressing stupor and ultimately sounds as if the chocobo faded away into the clouds below never to be seen again. I'll just stick to Final Fantasy 9's Ukulele de Chocobo thank you very much.Grade: D-6: Troops March OnThis is not one of the songs I would have chosen for the soundtrack, and even after hearing it again as I'm writing this review, I can't imagine why it was picked. However, despite my disapproval on the song choice for this soundtrack I was pleasantly surprised at how well it started out. They did a great job of capturing that overbearing military occupation feel, and had they left off at near 2 minute mark on this song it would have been just fine. The problem is that it kept going for another 2 and a half minutes on a theme that I neither recognized from the OST nor enjoyed.Grade: D7: Kids Run Through the City CornerAnother must have choice for the album, and another song that falls short of the mark. I LOVED this song, by far the best town theme from any game, and sure enough 1 minute and 12 seconds into this 3 minute and 14 second long song it fully captures, if briefly everything this song should be. And so, for 2 minutes and 2 seconds, I listen to one of the most beautiful songs I've heard, and then am left wishing the first third of this song wasn't wasted on an overly-embellished and dragged out introduction. The meat of this song is far too short, and the intro just gets more and more annoying with each listen.Grade: C8: BlackjackThis is theme of Setzer's airship, The Blackjack. An understandable pick for the soundtrack, though not one I, myself, would have made. This song suffers from much the same malaise as that of Milan de Chocobo. It was intended to sound pastoral, and soaring, and tranquil, but where Milan de Chocobo sounds utterly asleep and uncaring, this is as high as a kite. This song never really comes down to the ground. It flutters around what made the original song as strong as it was, and that was the hard brass section and the much faster tempo. It's not really a bad arrangement, but it emphasizes all the weaknesses inherent to the original version of this song and none of the strengths.Grade: C-9: RelmI actually loved Relm, and think it's one of the highlights on this CD. I think it's more of a personal preference regarding the bagpipes. I'll admit they're a bit jarring if you don't like that sound, but if you're okay with bagpipes it's very great, and reminds me a whole lot of Aerith's Theme from FF7 in terms of the arrangement, almost as if this were a trial run at what Aerith's theme would be. It never strayed too far from the original melody and always kept with the theme of who Relm was. I really have a hard time thinking of it as anything but Aerith's Theme with a happy serene feel. Where Aerith's Theme revolved around the sadness of her death, this is the celebration of the innocence of a young child with a bright future.Grade: A10: Mystery TrainThis would have been a very happily received choice for this soundtrack. The Ghost Train did much what you might imagine, it was a train for the souls of the recently departed to take to the other side. At the end of this "act" in the game you're left with Cyan being forced to say goodbye to the ghosts of his wife and son, while Sabin and Shadow look on, silently and helplessly. The original song used handbells to introduce the melody, then was followed by brass and strings plodding along in a slow but deliberate march to the drumbeat that was played to a rythem reminiscent of a train clacking over its tracks. It was sad and creepy, and very deliberate. This re-orchestration begins with some violins played rather harshly, and then speeds up dramatically with the piano ranging all over the place in minor keys, and at about 1 minute in, the melody completely leaves its origins and only once comes back for the briefest of moments. It does fit better with its title of Mystery Train, but even then it's not all that entertaining.Grade: F11: Aria di Mezzo CarattereThe quintessential song of Final Fantasy 6, no FF6 soundtrack could be taken seriously without this song. This is a fantastically performed and beautifully arranged version of the opera song Celes (or Tina if you prefer) performs at the opera house. It captures everything from that song perfectly, and is possibly the very best song Nobuo Uematsu has ever written. I do have one complaint though, and that is that it's a direct rip from the Dream Oath Opera from the 4th Orchestral Game Concert and in my opinion should be listened to in the context of that much more impressive suite, that truly is Uematsu's grand opus.Grade: A (if listened to within the entire Dream Oath Opera suite: A++)Overall Grade: C-

review/summary: An entirely different FF VI
review/text: In my opinion, FF VI is the best soundtrack Maestro Uematsu has composed, in tie with FF VII. However, this soundtrack does not match in par with &quot;Fithos Lusec Vicos Wenosec&quot;, the orchestrated version of FF VIII. The main reason why I deducted three stars off the list is because the arranger have annilated much of the original feel of FF VI's soundtrack and the arrangement can only be simplified as - beautiful but horrid. Most of the original melodies set by Maestro Uematsu have slight modifications and loads of additional music that is contrast with the game's original atmosphere and feeling. Only songs like &quot;Tina&quot;, &quot;The mystic forests&quot;,&quot;Troops march on&quot; and &quot;Aria Di Mezzo Carattere&quot; has the feel no different from the original sound version. Here's a brief rundown on each tracks;1. Tina - Well done and the most original rearrangement in this CD. A minor complaint is that the bells are slightly off-pitched and it may annoy listeners.2. Cefca - Sounds like some theme from a cartoon show, which may describe the original villian (Kefka), but misses the grim, dark, and cold sadistic nature of the original theme.3. The mystic forest - The spooky theme played by the pan pipe is good, but the major complaint is the theme is not complete ,thus making the song sounded very different from the game version.4. Gau - The pastoral theme played by Bach-like orchestration is excellent. Unfortunately why the heck you have a Bach-like dance by the middle part of the song? Totally contrast to the character himself who is a lone wanderer.5. Milan De Chocobo - Milan version of the famed Chocobo theme? It has tonal influences of Ravel and jazz influence of Gershwin. Quite original, but i'll have the groovy game version instead.6. Troops march on - Another song which is almost close to the mood of the game version. A sub-melody after the theme doesn't have any connection with the theme of the song and you'll probably skip this.7. Kids run through the city corner - The main bummer of this CD because it was well done and the abrupt ending will leave you aghast.8. Blackjack - Instead of John William or Richard Wagner's style of a high-adrenaline flight on an airship, we get a &quot;stroll -on a -pastoral -greenhill&quot; arrangement. You'll skip this daringly innovative but numb arrangement here.9. Relm - A mixed bag. I like the orchestration here, but the &quot;Italian&quot; feel and the bagpipes annoy me like heck and i think this is the worst track ever.10. Mistery Train - An arrangement of string quartet with piano. Sounds like some thriller from an old black and white movie, but the spookiness is missing. The &quot;conversation&quot; between the strings and the piano is awkward, thus another &quot;bummer&quot; in this CD.11. Aria de mezzo carattere - The orchestral araangement is fine and i have no complaint whatsovever except for the soprano who over-vibbrated her voice too much. I don't expect that from a professional opera singer. You may say this is the way people sing, but i say this is &quot;spooky&quot;.Overall, a heck of a mixed bag and i would strongly advice you to listen carefully to the songs before buying. By professional standards, classical or conservative, it's a big time flop with so much potentials in the album wasted. But a five-star to Uematsu and some credit to the orchestra as the strings are much better than FLVW (FF VIII). Till then, i'll stick to the game version.11.

review/summary: Not the perfect Final Fantasy VI arranged soundtrack, but a worthy one.
review/text: Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale holds the distinctions of being based on the greatest video game soundtrack ever and of being my first arranged game soundtrack. So this disc has high expectations to live up to. About half of its tracks I am totally satisfied with the way they were done. A few follow their original game versions rather closely and sound terrific performed by real instruments. In others the arrangements vary slightly from the originals, but the changes follow the spirit of the OSV closely. I'm especially happy with the excellent version of the game's opening theme.However, there's a slightly different story to other tracks on the CD. In some arrangements there are small changes that hurt an entire piece. For example, an otherwise perfect rendition of Relm's theme is ruined for me by blaring bagpipes. Others have changes that make them considerably different from the original versions. One example would be "Gau", which although a nice arrangement in its own right, doesn't posess the eye-watering quality of the original.Most Final Fantasy fans will probably feel that this CD doesn't live up to the original soundtrack it is based on. Of course, many Final Fantasy fans - myself included - feel that the original soundtrack is one of the greatest musical achievements ever. A hard label to live up to. I must credit the arrangers for having a cinematic vision when they went about embellishing these compositions. I remember when I first got the CD, listening intently and envisioning the characters moving through my own little Final Fantasy movie as the music progressed. Fond memories, to be sure. So while this CD may not be the dream Final Fantasy VI arranged collection, it is nonetheless an interesting and entertaining one which fans should be hesitant to miss.

review/summary: Why Some People Complain
review/text: The thing that most people don't understand about the FFVI sound track is that it couldn't possibly sound the same as the game. When people buy it they are expecting the exact same music and they heard while playing it, but it just wouldn't be done. On the original SNES system that this game was made for it had a very poor sound quality system in it. It was only about 16 bits if even that much. Nobody would want to listen to the poor quality music that the game produced when they could hear it orchestrated and remastered like the future FF Series games had. All in all i thought that this sound track was an excellent portrayal of the way the music should have sounded, had the game been placed on a CD based system instead of a 16 bit SNES cartridge system.

review/text: This CD is pretty good. But they didn't include The Veldt! That's the music that plays while you're walking around on the Veldt trying to get Gau to join the party.Some of the other choices are weak. The Veldt should have been included, and in my opinion, that oversight is too huge to make this CD worth buying.

review/summary: Incredible arrangement
review/text: Like many fans of game music, the Final Fantasy VI soundtrack originally got me interested in the genre. As a fan of classical music, I have always eagerly awaited official symphonic arrangements of my favorite game tunes, and Grande Finale is probably the best of said arrangements.The music of FFVI is always emotional: sometimes brooding, sometimes hopeful, sometimes exciting. This arrangement showcases Uematsu's versatility as a composer and his cognizance of classical instruments. There are no synthesizers on this CD: only real performances with real instruments. The arrangement of the Aria is the best that has ever been done, and this CD is worth having just for that track. No track disappoints, and all should bring the nostalgic gamer back to the fun days of Super Nintendo gaming.Not all video game lovers will appreciate this; even true Final Fantasy fans may be turned off by the soft style and lack of exciting battle themes. However, the music is well arranged, well performed, and breaks down the lines between game music and neoclassical composition. People who do not like the synthesized game sounds may appreciate Grande Finale for its imagination and simple charm. While this CD is not a must-buy for everyone, I recommend it to anyone who loved FFVI and anyone who appreciates good symphonic music.

review/summary: One of the best classical music CD
review/text: I have the original soundtrack for FF6 But I still love this CD. Well, since it's not OST so don't expect to hear the original music you heard while playing game. All pieces are played by symphony orchestra and, as a classical music lover myself, I enjoy this CD as much as Vivaldi's Four Season!! Every song was well rearranged and perfectly presented in symphonic style...Warning!! if you're only gamers and don't think any classical music is worth listening, don't buy this CD.. But if you're classical music lovers as well, buy it..!! Whether or not you've ever played the game, the beauty of the music will make you not to regret every penny you spend..!!

review/text: Being a great fan of ff6,I was impatient to listen to this record.At first I thought it was impressive with the orchestra.But then the more I listened to it the more I felt a bit disapointed.I think that some songs dont grasp the original feeling of the game and that some of them dont even respect the original tunes.But you mustnt get me wrong,it still stays a wonderful record,even though it is not totally faithful to the game. Anyway the best advice I can give is to LISTEN TO SOME SONGS BEFORE BUYING IT,to avoid any disapointment.

review/text: As a youngster when the original game came out, the music playing in the background of the game influenced me to an impressive degree. Since this was one of the first games I really played through several times, it was really ingrained into my psyche. At times I would even play through the game just to hear the music. When I heard there was a CD of it done by a full orchestra, needless to say, I was excited. The renditions are very well done, and feature some exotic instrumentation (bagpipes for Relm... rather unusual, but very effective). I was particularly captured by the Aria (the opera house song/Celes's theme). I've played it for people who had never even heard of the game, and they's remarked at how beautiful it is. For those who have an emotional attachment to the game, it's an intense experience. I would highly recommend it to anyone, but particularly those who have played the game and loved it.

review/summary: A Little Different, But Amazing Nevertheless...
review/text: Reading the other reviews, I can understand some of their complaints. Yes, some of the selections are not the most exciting from the OSV, and some of the songs have undergone "surgery", so to speak. However, if one can just dig a little deeper into the music, they will discover how truly amazing this CD is. Nobuo Uematsu's simple yet fantastic melodies are blended with a mature orchestra sound to achieve a high level of greatness.Track Listing:Opening Theme: This is beyond words. Very similar to the OSV version, only now the song has that rich texture that only a live orchestra can provide.Cefca: Good. I do agree that some of the darker tone the OSV version had has been removed, but this arrangement is still enjoyable.The Mystic Forest: Hauntingly beautiful with a very surreal, mysterious tone.Gau: Excellently orchestrated, nice use of cello.Milan de Chocobo: Personally being a fan of the fast-paced, jovial qualities of the Chocobo themes from the games, I was initially put off by this track, but as I have heard it more and more I have come to appreciate the tonal qualities; very modern.Troops March On: Very rousing piece; you can see the soldiers marching in formation. Really the only rousing peace on the whole album, in terms of style.Kids Run Through The City Corner: I agree that the introduction to this track is a little bland and long, but once the piece enters the original theme, all is forgiven. Excellent use of strings.Blackjack: Very pastoral. While listening you can see the hills and mountains moving by as though you were on the Blackjack itself. Doesn't quite have the pulse of the OSV version though.Relm: Very well done. This is one of the better pieces on the album. The bagpipes are obtrusive but the rest of the arrangement more than makes up for it. If you liked it on the OSV then you'll like it here.Mistery Train: This piece received the most "surgery" of any of these on the disc. Whereas the OSV version suggested the use of a full orchestra with brass, this version is merely a piano and violin. It is still very enjoyable and the arrangement gives it even more of a "blues" feel.Aria Di Mezzo Carattere: What can I say? This track is wonderful as well. While not my favorite--I'm not an opera fan, so sue me--I still find this enjoyable. The melody of Celes's Theme is amazing no matter how it is performed. And unlike the simple notes of the OSV version, this arranged adaptation of the aria has lyrics in Italian.All in all, this is an excellent CD. None of the tracks are bad if you have a sophisticated enough taste in music. If you like any of Final Fantasy VI's music--or any of Nobuo Uematsu's, for that matter--no matter what form, you will probably like this album.

review/summary: Sound: Great! Re-Composition: Bad!
review/text: Don't get me wrong, I own both this and the FFVI OSV, because the music simply amazing. However, this CD didn't quite live up to what I was expecting. True, the first track is superb, and some of the others are cool to listen to, but some are re-wired to the extream.I first noticed it as a problem in the Kefka track (the second one!), where I was only about a minute into it where I could no longer recognize it! Relm's theme was done with bagpipes, and while I laughed at first, I was later upset by its failure to subside.I was also really mad by the track selection. I was expecting &quot;Dancing Mad&quot; (the final battle theme) instead of these tracks. True, some of those tracks are classics, but a good chunk of these are the few tracks I skip over when I listen to the OSV.I won't deny that this does have great stuff, but I just want to tell you all that this CD is not the perfect CD I was hoping for! If you truely love all FF6 music, and don't mind if it's been redone, than get it, for then you will love it! More than me, at least.

review/summary: Might not be for everyone, but I definitely loved it!
review/text: So, judging by some of the other reviews for this CD, I can assume that this album might not appeal to everyone. That is understandable because everyone's taste varies, this is what gives life so much spice.All of that being said and gotten out of the way, I will do my best to make this review as unbiased and honest as I can.As background, this album has a lot of emotional attachment for me. I absolutely loved the game when I was growing up, and I remember seeing this album when my parents and I were at a comic book-esque store (I'm not sure how to describe it, they sold everything there from anime and manga, to Comics and music, clothes. figurines). I was so excited to get it. It was a bit expensive, as it still seems to be, however they bought it for me in exchange for doing extra-chores. I excitedly agreed and this album with interesting cover-art was in my possession. From the moment I popped it in the CD player, I loved it, from beginning to end (accept for Relm, the bagpipe seemed really out of place. They should have used a Clarinet or something). After well-over a decade, I still have fond memories of it and enjoy listening to it.Getting that out of the way, I think it might not be possible for me to be completely objective. I think this is a fantastic album, and while I can understand how some classical aficionados might not be as excited about it as others, I think Mr. Uematsu did a wonderful job composing and conducting this.If you go onto your favorite video-sharing site, you should be able to find some complete recordings of some of the songs to give you a taste of what it sounds like. If you enjoyed Video Games Live (which was on PBS), then chances are you are going to love this album.I definitely recommend this album, however if you are skeptical I verily encourage you to find some decent samples and listen to it first to get a taste. If you enjoy it, then please buy it! Music like this needs to be supported.

review/summary: Stunning. Simply Stunning.
review/text: Final Fantasy VI Grande Finale: an orchestrated album of some of video gaming's best songs, and a must-buy. All of the tracks are fully orchestrated and rewritten, allowing for a new feel and added flavor.Tina - A great start to a great album. An almost Batman-esque sound followed by the better-known overworld theme, and at times vaguely reminiscent of the ever-popular Prologue.Kefka - If you weren't told this was Kefka's theme, you might not realize for the first 20 seconds. An interesting piano introduction leading to a woodwind version of Kefka's bouncy and mocking theme.The Mystic Forest - A mellow, sweeping song that seems melancholy at times, but always maintains the air of control.Gau - This song was one of my favorites in the original soundtrack, and it remains so with this remake. The use of strings is superb. While I would have preferred a deeper and richer sound for the melody, this song still incredible.Milan de Chocobo - An orchestrated version of the famed Chocobo theme? You bet! I never thought I'd hear a mellow yet whimsical version of this theme, but here it is. Very intriguing, with interesting countermelodies and a unique bass line.Troops March On - Start out with a drum roll, and bring in the majestic horn section. A truly regal-sounding theme with excellent varied use of instruments and sounds.Kids Run Through the City Corner - Violins set the tone for this next track with a drawn-out introduction leading into the familiar village theme. Very nice use of strings in this piece.Blackjack - This track starts out sounding almost like a Gershwin piece, or a park scene from a Broadway musical, but it shortly resolves into a woodwind version of the Blackjack theme from the soundtrack.Relm - This was one of the sweetest themes in the soundtrack, though the synth bagpipe sound turned some people off. In this orchestrated version, real bagpipes are used, providing a rustic feel while maintaining the lilting theme in the wind section.Mystery Train - Whereas the original track utilized 'spooky' instruments to relay a feeling of urgency, this track starts out with violins melodies, adding in a piano countermelody shortly thereafter. An intriguing twist on an already interesting song.Aria di Mezzo Carattere - Being a fan of opera, this track blew me away. Using an opera in a video game seemed surprising enough, but changing it into a well-orchestrated and well-sung Italian opera went beyond what I had ever expected, even of Nobuo Uematsu. I fell in love with Celes's theme before I even knew I was into gaming music. When the opera scene came up, it almost made me want to cry, it was so touching. This version does even more than the original could, and the soloist is superb. My favorite track of the album.Having reviewed every track separately, it only confirms my feeling that this is one of the best, if not the best, video game music albums ever recorded. It definitely deserves a five-star rating. I applaud Uematsu on his work.

review/summary: Perhaps the most memorable, if not the best, music by Nobuo
review/text: For all of those who didn't like this soundtrack or who didn't give it a full five stars for its quality, I'm writing this review. Let me just say that a true lover of &quot;classical&quot; or movie music should truly enjoy this soundtrack all by itself; and for those who are not only among that order but who've had these tunes running in their head for years ever since they first played the game itself, this is a must-have item. Upon first hearing the orchestral versions of these songs via Napster MP3, I was blown away: Those beautiful layers of mellow strings and dazzling piano and every other orchestral instrument make it all worthwhile. It's simply a more refined and mature interpretation of the music that's just fantastic to hear. One might say it's almost like turning your favorite pop into a beautifully blended wine. My one favorite song had originally been the Aria, but sadly, the reworked &quot;Kefka&quot; was just plain gorgeous; the two are now in close competition. I only wish the lot of you could preview the music on the website through RealAudio to judge for yourself more precisely. Apparently, it's not popular enough for that! Needless to say, get this soundtrack if you don't have it already: it's worth it.

review/summary: Beautiful, Astonishing Album!
review/text: I love this album so much! As a classical music lover and devoted Nobuo Uematsu fan, the concept of the album really appealed to me. I really enjoyed the fusion of classical music with some of my favorite songs in the game. My favorite track on this album by far was "Aria Di Mezzo Carattere", which adds a whole new level to the already beautiful song- the lyrics are actually sung in Italian. Other tracks I enjoyed were:"Opening Theme~Tina"- which is a blend of "The Opening Theme" and "Tina" (known as "Terra" to those of us playing the NA versions of the game), which sounds like it came from a Spaghetti Western"Gau"- the cello is lovely"Kids Run Through the City Corner"- I love how the violin and harpsichord "flirt" with each other in the introduction, and then work together afterwards"Relm"- which has a harpsichord AND bagpipes in it!"Mystery Train"- There is some intense violin and piano on this trackEven if you're not the biggest fan of classical music, you will still enjoy this album if you love the music in Final Fantasy VI. I definitely recommend it!

review/summary: Disco God !
review/text: This is not just some sort of disco a la Francaise. Just before he died during the peak of the disco days, Clo-Clo left the best disco music ever created. Not only does this album burn, but Clo-Clo seems to put all his heart and voice in this timeless recording. &quot;Magnolias are Forever&quot; competes with &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; for a choice party album. Yet, keep in mind that &quot;Magnolias&quot; isn't a compilation. Overcome the language and you'll discover that Clo-Clo was a natural in making some of the best disco. Any discophile needs this album if he really claims to be one. All French people refer to this particular album when remembering the immortal Clo-Clo!

review/summary: Works Great - Tastes Awful
review/text: This has to be the worst tasting spray in the universe, it is simply awful. But, it works incredibly well.Two sprays just before going to bed and it seems to help whenever my throat feels raw or I have a slight cough. Nothing scientific, but it also seems to help with my snoring. There is a double benefit. I don't use this every night, only when my throat feels a bit raw.Over time I've gotten used to the nasty taste. Because it works so well, it's beginning to taste just fine. The flavor is a bit like those ancient horehound drops my grandmother made me take, without the sweetness (Horehound Drops Bag: 24 Count).I'd like to claim that this spray cures all diseases and makes you more attractive - but it really only has two uses in my book, sore throat and snoring.

review/summary: Helps with serious throat issues!
review/text: Zand Throat Spray has been a life saver for me.I'm a Cancer survivor and I'm still pretty beat up. A few years ago, during treatment, I collapsed from Anaphylactic Shock. That permanently damaged my Epiglottis, the flap that covers (protects) your windpipe when you swallow food or liquids. I then began aspirating foods into my Lungs. As a result, I had 16 bouts with Terminal Pneumonia. I'm a fighter, so I survived, but only by the Grace of God.So now I experience a strong biting feeling in my deep throat. It causes me to cough uncontrollably. But, with a couple of sprays of this product it ceases. What a gift!I don't know how I could live without it.TaosGuy

I knew I had to cough to get all that yucky stuff out of my lungs but there were times I thought I would pass out from coughing. Thank goodness for this throat spray. When I could not stop coughing, it helped to settle the cough enough so I could catch my breath! Cough drops just took to long to work and were too sweet. I am always going to have this one in my medicine chest.

review/text: For the price, this glider is a grade A product. It arrived very quickly and the box contained all necessary (except for obviously needed general tools) materials. Assembly was super simple but a second person would be helpful, but not absolutely necessary, to hold some pieces together while inserting fasteners. The materials quality appears to be very good, but only time and exposure to a few Vermont winters will tell the true story. All in all, we are very pleased with this comfortable two person glider.

review/summary: My favorite spot for an iced tea break
review/text: We wanted a sturdy, weather resistant, and reasonably attractive glider for the back deck--but the nice-looking $300-and-up ones weren't in the budget. I hesitated on this a bit because it would be inconvenient to return if it wasn't good. Fortunately, it's a keeper. Granted, it may not have the charm of something fancier, but the simple lines are quite pleasing. The materials feel solid and it's very comfortable, with a gentle, pleasant motion. Pretty easy to assemble (once the male person of the household deigned to look at the instructions). The only things that kept it from a 5-star rating were a few minor nicks in the paint on the frame and the fact that we had to do a little bending on one of the bars to make it swing freely without hitting the frame. Otherwise, excellent!

review/summary: Great Glider, Easy to Assemble
review/text: My aunt and I were able to assemble this in about 20 minutes even though we didn't have the proper tools (a 5/16 wrench and a 7/16 wrench, in addition to the Allen key they provide-- and, of course, a Phillips head screwdriver). We ended up just using pliers to tighten the screws, and that worked fine. We hit only one snag when ONE of us, and I won't mention WHO (*cough* her) confused "right" with "left," so we had to take it apart and redo it properly. Even so, 20 minutes in the light rain at dusk and we were gliding away right afterwards. The directions are fine and everything lined up as it should.We fit two adults and a child and it glides nicely and feels comfortable. Because of the neutral colors, I'm going to buy a colorful cushion to put on the seat just for looks, but you don't actually need a cushion-- the molded plastic feels fine.The only reason I'm deducting a star is that several of the steel pieces were scratched up. They have a coating (vinyl, it seems) over all the steel, but the coating scratches off easily. So right out of the box, I had about four spots that looked worn, and then when we dropped one piece, it mangled the vinyl on another. Luckily, it's all down low and not noticeable, but it still shouldn't be like that when an item is brand new. And I worry about rust on the places where the coating scratched off.Still, I'm very happy with this purchase. It's a good price for a sturdy glider that should last for a long time. I was close to buying a used wooden glider locally for about the same price, but I'm glad I decided to check Amazon first.

review/summary: Relaxing
review/text: I bought this glider to put on my front porch. I wanted one that didn't take up too much space and yet would seat more than one person comfortably. This one suits that purpose just right. The neutral color would fit in anywhere. With my spinal problems and pinched nerves, I need something comfortable to sit on. My husband put it together and I didn't hear any grumbling while he did it. It glides smoothly and quietly and in a few weeks it should be a perfect place to sit and observe the hummingbirds. I had a bit of trouble finding a place to order a cushion that would fit it, but I finally did. (Look up glider cushions online.) My wooden and metal bench on the same porch is showing age and carpenter bees are attaching it. That won't happen with this glider. I would recommend this glider to a friend.

review/text: I bought this for my 92 year old mother who has always enjoyed her outside time. The bench is sturdy enough for her to get into by herself from her walker. She loves it. Instructions are good and as the instructions say two people are needed in my opinion for the last two steps. You need a phillips screwdriver, a 5/16 and a 7/16 wrench to assemble. We were impressed with how well the parts aligned and only had a little problem with one screw - probably our fault for tighting the other screws before setting the last screw in the bench back. Solid bench, glides without ball bearings, will update on how well it weathers the Pennsylvania winter.

review/summary: FANTASTIC PURCHASE!!!!!
review/text: This Gliding bench is absolutely wonderful! After I ordered it I thought I was crazy for buying something like this without having actually sat in it and tried it. I started thinking, "what if all those wonderful reviews were bogus - it will be too heavy to afford return shipping!!!!" First, this review is not bogus AND I am so glad I made this purchase!!!!! It does recommend two people to put it together but I only needed help on the very last step so it is very easy to assemble and very sturdy. It glides very smoothly. I'm deaf so I can't tell you if it makes sound when it glides but can say that I LOVE our summer evenings on the back porch now, enjoying our beautiful flowers and fresh air. My awesome Hearing Dog - a beautiful blond Lab and I sit together on this bench and will enjoy many wonderful moments together lounging about!!!!

review/summary: Fantastic glider/ bench
review/text: Right after I clicked the purchase button for this, I remember wondering what the heck I was doing buying a glider bench off the internet. It was so reasonably priced compared to the ones I had checked out in stores, I figured I was getting some flimsy, poorly made item. But this bench is awesome! My husband put it together in about 30 minutes by himself and it's sturdy but light enough that I can drag it around our backyard to catch the sun (or not). It has held up to all the wet weather we've had, it's easy to clean and glides beautifully. It really is a quality product - I'm thinking of buying a second one for our patio.

The hardest part was getting it unwraped, which was worth it. It was in great condition, all parts needed, even some tools and good instructions. It works great and looks nice on my new front deck.

review/summary: Practical glider
review/text: Bought this as an anniversary gift for my parents knowing they needed seating out near a family pond. Looked at wicker, aluminum products etc., but knew this would stand the test of the elements. Easy to put together (less than an hour) and comfortable to sit in. Only complaint would be its appearance - very plain looking and the "putty" color = gray doesn't really help matters. If you don't care about aesthetics, purchase this bench for comfort and security in knowing it will last outside in the weather.

review/text: It took about 30 min max to put together. Not many parts, one screw was missing but its not really needed. The gliding motion is just ok. It feels kinda short, doesnt mimic a real swing as well as the other glider I bought. But it seems really durable and will last outside in the elements. Really good to sit in around a pool/hot tub/lake where you will be getting it wet as the plastic wont weather like wood.

review/summary: James Moody takes San Diego &quot;Beyond the Border&quot;!
review/text: James Moody, and his well known &quot;cast of characters&quot; have put together an awsome sample of what can be done when you think everything else has already been done... I really enjoy listening to this up and coming jazz artist because he has a style that is all his own. I play this CD everytime I am trying to impress someone...and it never fails to do the job. There are some really great songs in new styles that consistantly perk up my friends ears when they hear it. They know that song, but they've &quot;never heard it played like THAT before&quot;.

review/summary: Heart Pounding Reach Out and Grab You By the Soul Fabulous!
review/text: This new artist gives jazz music a new and vibrant shade. I LOVED this CD because it is NOT the &quot;same 'ol thang&quot;. It is new and original. It made me want to dance, it made me want to discover far off places, it made me want to run &quot;Beyond the Borders&quot; and find the secret that this guitar player from California seems to have discovered. I am excited to hear cuts from &quot;Beyond the Borders&quot; more and more on our local east coast jazz stations, and predict that before Moody's next run for the border, he will be more than a familiar name on the international jazz scene. One last thing to share. This music is &quot;fresh&quot;! If you are looking for music that speaks to you, that reaches out, grabs you by the soul, and throws you into a whole new world of &quot;feel good&quot;, then you have GOT TO get this CD! Trust me, YOU WON'T BE SORRY!

review/summary: Exquisetely tasty passionate jazz with a latin tinge
review/text: I stumbled upon this artist in Catalina on a recent vacation. He was playing live, and it was tasty enough I took the risk to pick up the CD. I figured if this guy sounded good live, the studio version would sound good too. I wasn't dissappointed.The overall genre is jazz, but it's got a lot of latin influences. Moody plays lyrical, passionate solos, and you always know there is a a full rack of chops he's not displaying. Dig: Kenny G sounds like (he could just barely make the lick, but boy was it Fast); Moody sounds like he's really saying something through his guitar. If you listen to the 'smooth jazz' radio station, you'll probably like the sound of this album. If you prefer more traditional jazz, you'll like the improvising and the good feeling rhythm section.&quot;Palmita Blanca&quot; and &quot;Minor Swing&quot; both have that understated elegance that makes this kind of music more popular than ever. What makes this stand out from a Peter White track, is that the improvisation actually propels the cut; it soars. My Favorite track is &quot;Billies' Bounce&quot;. You think you've heard this one everyway-including-bagpipes? Think again; Moody's got a fresh take.All in all, this is a sweet sounding CD that crosses boundaries of style and genre. Big Al says &quot;Chech it out&quot;

review/summary: IV stars
review/text: Although I've always liked Seal, this is actually the first album I picked up from him. I read a lot of reviews and most people are saying that his first two albums were his best ones. Maybe that's true, but that doesn't mean there aren't any gems to be found on his fourth album.As usual, you'll find some nice ballads on here, like "Don't Make Me Wait", "Tinsel Town" and "Love's Divine". And the funky tracks are also good, as evidenced by the first single, "Waiting For You". Seal also does a good job of covering otherwise played-out subject matter, like the we-are-the-world song "Get It Together" and the keep-your-head-up song "Where There's Gold". Unfortunately, though, I can't say the same about "Let Me Roll", a rather silly attempt at a club-rocker.I didn't really care for "Touch" either, but that's okay because songs like the laid back "Loneliest Star" will remind you why you picked this album up to begin with. And no offense, but I wonder if the reviewers that complained that Seal isn't getting any airplay in the States have ever heard of VH1. Anyway, Seal IV definitely gets the seal of approval.Anthony Rupert

review/text: I am a huge fan of Seal's first 3 albums, so I rushed out to buy this one the minute it came out. What a disappointment!! Most of the songs sound like old remixes of Curtis Mayfield tunes. The only 2 with that eerie signature 'Seal' sound are 'heavenly' and 'tinsel town'. I'd say go to Itunes....listen to the songs...buy the tunes you like (if there are any) and call it a day.

review/summary: Disappointing but I just keep hoping....
review/text: I have been a big Seal fan ever since his first album came out. He became a household name with Seal II becuase its an amazingly deep and well produced album with great songwriting and vocal performances. Getting his single on the Batman soundtrack didnt hurt sales, either. When Seal III came out and was a commercial flop, I was not suprised. But poor sales dont mean an album is bad,just as big album sales dont necessarily mean a great album. Seal III is an artistic triumph. Some of the songs (ie No Easy Way)are utterly beautiful. Please give it a listen, readers. That being said, we come to the topic of the new album, Seal IV. I was waiting for something at least as good as Seal III, and hopeing for something even better. Like its predecessor it also appears to be a commercial letdown. I personally have not even listend to it many times. The reason for that is that I just can't stand hearing it for more than a few minutes at a time. There is one HUGE,GLARING PROBLEM with Seal IV. For me , that problem lies in the fact that Seal chose to Pitch Correct his voice on on this album, and it sticks out BIG TIME! Seal, I hope you read this review! Your voice shouldn't ever be tampered with in that way again! It takes the soul out of the vocal performances! I really am disappointed that you allowed that to happen. It sucks. The subtle pitch imperfections that are part of a natural vocal are GLARINGLY missing. You dont need to resort to such studio tricks. You're no amatuer. Dont follow that trend! Its a crappy trend. Its the type of trick that producers for film songs resort to when trying to get Eddie Murphy's "Donkey" to sing on pitch. Ah, the heights from which you have fallen. I pray that your next album wont suffer from such a blatent identity crisis. Your unique raspy voice is one of the things you are known and loved for. Why tamper with it? Please! I anxiously await Seal V!

His voice reaches out to you with every song, every verse, every chorus. With this CD, he is a musical genius! I'm totally in love with this CD! Especially track #3 - Waiting for You! Oh, what can I say about this song...it's so lovely, it's a loving song, in fact, every one is a loving song. They all express love, emotion and your inner being.

review/summary: The Adventures of Thumbs Up Johnnie Jimmy Jam Germ & the Happy Handshake
review/text: I had heard about this book from a friend of mine who lives in Missouri, who is a school nurse. My children's school contacted the author and she came to our school with mascots and party favors for the kids. After reading her book Johnnie Finds A Buddy, she read this book to the kids and they went wild. She taught them the "CLEAN HAND JIVE"- her song about washing your hands. At their school they teach the importance of washing your hands and even have a unit in science and their health classes about this topic. Most of the children do not find the topic of hand hygeine very interesting. To see the reaction of the kids after Michelle Bain read the book to the children my kids school we were pleasantly suprised. Finally, an author came up with a "spin" on hand hygeine that was funny and impactful at the same time. I hope that this writer tackles many of these subjects in the future!

review/text: This Soundtrack has to be one of the oddest, yet beautifully composed of all time! This 3 pack contains music from one of the most famous Playstation rpg of all time! The music is made up of Synthesizers which form a strange tune,and at the same time sound as if it were composed exclusively for an Orchestra, yet alot of it makes you wonder if it were Heavy Metal rather than all the above! The Music is hard to explain, but much of it has you imagine yourself playing the roles of a hero on a quest, or of any other storylines of the Popular Saga Frontier series. This cd is a must to game soundtrack collectors, Heavy Metal Collectors, Orchestra, RPG fans, or people into unique music. Its worth it.

review/text: Though it would be wrong to compare them since Umatsu feels like classical music while this is a sometimes ambient tropical feel or just plain avant garde electronic battle music, which is the high point in the album. Anyone who has played the game know's theres around a dozen or so battle themes and they all are just so beatifully composed, that it makes you wonder why square dosent use this composer so much. It might be tempting to buy it if you havent played the game (since the music always make you think of the worlds were it was used in the game) but if youre a videogame music aficionado, then this soundtrack would be on your top 5.

Although there was little mention of people from my direct line, this was an extremely interesting read of the history after the town was founded in 1630. The history and characters are real and the various chapter authors did an excellent job of researching facts and putting them into facinating stories. This book gave me a better understanding of what several generations went through in order to make Woburn what it is today. This would be a great read for anyone interested in the early history of the United States.

review/text: Hey, so I pride myself on being open-minded about music and enjoy music from ABBA to Napalm Death, but this is the collection of a true connoisseur of music looking way beyond the pop-rock I'm at home with.As befits a friend of Robert Wyatt and an innovator in his own field (the field of surrealist mini-stories), Ivor Cutler has delved deep into the deepest riches of his music collection and come up with nothing predictable (beyond a Robert Wyatt track, of course) and some real odd-balls.The range is the most breathtaking I've ever found on one disk: from the most soulful blues, exhiliratingly complex piano work (Lennie Tristano's Turkish Mambo just blows fuses in my head every time I hear it), African dumming solos, stunning choral music from Arvo Part, Chinese singing, Nina Simone (swoon!): the first time I heard this album I felt like every track introduced me to something thrillingly new I'd somehow overlooked before.This compilation is an absolute gem and if you ever, ever found yourself looking at your CD collection and feeling somehow bored, you need this album. It's like a shot in the arm of the pure magic of music.Thank you, Ivor, and please, please, make another compilation.

Melissa & Doug didn't even have this quality AT ALL! THAT puzzle even has shards of wood sticking out I'm afraid of my son getting splinters! I am positive this puzzle will out last all the rest. The other puzzles are already showing wear on the pictures at the edges of the pieces-it's only been a few months! Also, the peices are thick enough that my son can stand them up-multi use toy :) I love it :)

It is the exclamation of Jacob who, upon waking from his dream about the ladder connecting heaven and earth, makes a startling realisation about the reality of the seemingly mundane and ordinary place where he had stopped for the night.In the prologue, Kushner develops an exegesis and hermeneutic of Genesis 28:16 more fully, and in so doing, illustrates many of the problems we regularly encounter, both in reading scripture as well as in interpreting daily life experience. He places this story in strong connection with the ordinary, even relating the angels on the ladder to common humanity:`There is another, even more obvious interpretation. The angels did not reside in heaven at all. They lived on earth. They were ordinary human beings. And, like ordinary human beings, they shuttled back and forth between heaven and earth. The trick is to remember, after you descend, what you understood when you were high on the ladder.'Kushner examines the way in which sages have interpreted this passage, and provides insights into history, psychology, philosophy, and scriptural study in the process. Each interpretation has had what one might call a personal conversation and experience with Jacob. In fact, each of these interpreters is portrayed as being on the ladder, rising and descending. The text is structured in this way. The interpreters are:+RashiSchelomo ben Yitzhaki, RashiThe key word for this interpretation is awareness. This is very important for making the kind of realisation that Jacob made. It is very important for us as we perceive the presence of God in our own lives.If I had known God was here, I wouldn't have gone to sleep.+KotzkMenachem Mendl of KotzkThe key concept here is egotism. Only by stripping away the ego can one begin to understand the presence and the personality of God.God was here because I was able to subdue my ego.+LudomirHannah Rachel Werbermacher, the Maid of LudomirA remarkable woman, a teacher of the Hasidim (who listened to her teaching through a half-open door, so as to preserve distance, and perhaps preserve a fiction that they were not in fact being taught by a woman), whose insight gave her access to the other side, or the many other sides, of stories being considered.God is present, even in the midst of evil.+MezritchDov Baer, the Maggid of MezritchThe word Maggid means 'storyteller'. Through the stories, here the key is self-reflection, to find meaning in the innermost being, to find that still, small voice that can only speak in silence and the absence of our own activity.God was here because I stopped being aware of myself.+NachmaniShmuel bar MachmaniWho was Jacob, and why should he know this? Who is God, and why should God do this? These are questions that are historical as much as theological or psychological, and it is in our history and God's history that we find meaning and identity.I could have climbed this ladder of history.+De LeonMoses ben Shem Tov de LeonA remarkable book, lost for a time, whose existence was denied even by Moses de Leon's widow, the Zohar, gives astonishing insight into the interior of God, reality, and our selves, and how to find a deep connection that is always present and never finished. Attributed to another author, Shimon bar Yohai, Kushner speculates that perhaps they shared the same soul. The completeness of the self of the universe connects through Jacob's story here.I is the Lord your God+OstropolShimshon ben Pesach OstropolerBeyond the question and awareness of the self of God and the self of the universe is the self, basic and simple, complex and intricate. Rabbi Shimshon put names to the kelipot, the broken shards of creation. We are all a part of a whole, a broken piece in and of ourselves. Our awareness of this helps begin the process of reunion.I didn't know that my name was part of God's nameEach interpreter's chapter stands on its own merits, but each is connected to the other, and to a wider body of interpretation and scholarship, by the use of side notes and references done in (what I would describe as being) a proto-talmudic structure. The Talmud has been described by some as one of the world's first hypertexts, with cross-links and chains that lead through the text -- this book does similar linking.Rabbi Kushner concludes by linking all the stories to the reader:`Each person has a Torah, unique to that person, his or her innermost teaching. Some seem to know their Torahs very early in life and speak and sing them in a myriad of ways. Others spend their whole lives stammering, shaping and rehearsing them. Some are long, some are short. Some are intricate and poetic, others are only a few words, and still others can only be spoken through gesture and example. But every soul has a Torah.'The relative place of self (both as an I and as an i) in God's life and universe becomes more apparent through these stories. Human beings are important, yet who can be important in relation to God? Yet, who is not important in relation to God? May this work help you discern where God is in your life, and what you are called to be.

review/summary: The hand of God
review/text: As you have gathered from the main review, this book focuses on the meaning of just one verse in Genesis, when Jacob awoke from the ladder dream. Usually Rabbis pick up on a verse just a couple verses back where &quot;the Angels of God were going up and down the ladder&quot;. The focus is that they start on Earth and go to Heaven - not the other way around.This book is great because it is like there is a dialog accross the space-time continuumn with 7 Rabbis in different locations and centuries arguing about their 7 different interpretations.One interpretation based on the fact that there are two &quot;I's&quot; in the verse spelled differently in Hebrew. It is that my Godlike &quot;I&quot; did not know God was present because my ego &quot;i&quot; was in the way. Jacob's chance to experience God was diminished because the ego &quot;i&quot; was ragiling off its commentary. This concept is similar to Buddism.Kushner adds an 8th interpretaion in his prolouge - which I won't spoil by going into detail. I heard Kushner talk at a Synagouge in Austin, Texas and he summarized his interpretation by finishing, &quot;Hold up your hands before your eyes. You are looking at the hands of God.&quot;A great book on modern Jewish mystism.

review/summary: Poetic and Intelligent
review/text: Kushner walks us through the exegetical vantage points of seven different rabbis, each looking at the same text. Jacob awakes from a dream about a ladder (Gen 28:16), and declares that he has experienced God. Kushner then poetically imagines the seven rabbis ascending and descending the ladder to teach us how to read the text. What results is a beautifully poetic look at the biblical text itself, a clever mode of teaching us Jewish history and midrash, and a fully postmodern system of acknowledging the existence of multiple perspectives. As with Kushner's other works (cf. Jewish Spirituality) it evolves into a mystical climax in which the reader and text are equated.The seven are:1. Rashi (Rabbi Shelomo ben Yitzhaki, @1050). He calls us to focus on the literal text without distraction, without background noise. He says that the real miracle of the burning bush required Moses to pay attention for more than a minute to realize that it was not burning (p. 24).2. Kotzk (Menachem Mendl of Kotzk, 1787-1859). He said that we needed to destroy our egos and should begin by calling ourselves liars (p. 38, 54). We should do this through gemilut hasidim, acts of selflessness (p. 51). Kotzk later in life condemned himself to solitude, only occasionally stepping onto his balcony to yell into the crowd, "You are all liars!"3. Ludomir (Hannah Rachel Werbermacher, 1805-1892). The only woman on the list, she called us to see that God was there even in the midst of evil. Teaching men through a half open door (p. 58), she taught them that God does not intervene in human affairs without human agency (p. 62). In fact, we are to assume that the fall in the garden was an act of God. God was present with Jacob in the angel that wrestled with him.4. Mezritch (Dov baer of Mezritch, d. 1772). He says that the goal of the religious life is devekut, cleaving to God (p. 84). Forced to follow a monk whose job it is to wash dishes (p. 87), he discovers that the purpose of life is to escape self-reflection to throw one's self whole-heartedly into one's role. Otherwise, as in a game of racquetball (p. 89), the self is always distracted when it focuses on anything other than its purpose. The self then becomes fragmented, with one part looking back at the rest to analyze its existence. "Too much concentration can be worse than none at all" (p. 90). We should be like the husband whose quest it is to find the right food for the pregnant wife in the middle of the night (p. 103). The "I did not know" of the Genesis text really refers to not paying attention to the "I."5. Nachmani (Samuel bar Nachmani, late 3rd c.). He sees in the story the issue of Jacob needing to become part of history, to take hold of history and enter into it.6. De Leon (Moses be Shem Tov de Leon, 1240-1305). De Leon wrote out a book called the Zohar (p. 130), and though he attributed it to a long-dead rabbi, he seems to have produced it himself. He says that the we are to accept who we are and put aside the veil of deceptive pseudo-identities. God's primary activity is to free us from the slavery to those self-deceptions. If God had a business card, the subline would read, "Frees slaves," and then "Call anytime" (p. 144). God is the sense of self, the "I," the Anochi, which is free.7. Ostropol (Shimson ben Pesach Ostropoler, d. 1648). He would say that it should be read, "God was in this place and I did not know it was i." We are somehow an indispensable part of God (p. 173). To look at your own hands is to look at the hands of God (p. 174). Somehow Abraham's father Terah was redeemed by the activities of Abraham himself. There is an old legend of Abraham smashing Terah's idols, and the conclusion is that the idolatries are redeemed by the son who is a part of him.The conclusion is that the text can be read legitimately through multiple lenses, and as we do so, our eyes are increasingly opened by and to the text. God may speak in any number of ways through our interaction with the text.It's a brilliant book, unlike most, both poetic and intelligent.

review/summary: Scholarly Spirituality
review/text: Rabbi Kushner takes a single line from the Torah and then gives seven traditional commentaries ranging from a 3rd century Palestinian rabbi to the &quot;Maid of Ludomir,&quot; who flourished 1500 years later. With each commentary, Kushner is able to shed light on a different aspect of God and extend each rabbinical reading into a comtemporary perspective. This is a marvelous melding of rabbinical scholarship and the renewed sense of spirituality in Judaism.

review/summary: A Recommendation for Christians
review/text: I discovered this book in a search for something new about the story of Jacob to enhance a short sermon. The book drew me into the world of 2500 years of Torah scholarship; into its great traditions of exposition, argument and story telling.The clear way in which Rabbi Kushner presents great thoughts of Torah scholars, his writing style, and love of their wisdom, allow the reader to "be" at once a yeshiva student and a friend worthy of intimate conversation. The chapter on De Leon - Rabbi Luria - which presents the 10 commandments as a circular system, offers unique insight.Rabbi Kushner's longing for the Messiah, which is so evident in his writing has added much to my understanding of my own faith.Rabbi Kushner's liberal use of story to explain on many levels that which is difficult to explain at all sheds a new light on the "parables" of JesusI eagerly seek out any word of a new book. It is a blessing that when other baby boomers were rejecting their faith and their heritage, Lawrence Kushner was embracing his, and doing all the hard work with the result that his readers are drawn to the Light. He is my most precious spiritual mentor.

review/summary: Too Much on the Mystical Plate
review/text: The idea behind God was in this Place and I, i did not know it is excellent. Take the famous line from Jacob at Beth-el, and see how it has been interpreted throughout the ages by various Jewish worthies. In the process, have them talk to Jacob in a kind of free form midrash, unshackled by time. And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, add a bit a personal reflection and home grown stories.All the elements are here, but the book never gets off the ground. In juggling so many elements in so short a space, Kushner gets lost, and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust. This would have been a good idea for two, maybe even three books. Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored.

review/text: What I didn't like about this book, was that I had finished reading it! Do you know the feeling of being so engaged you don't want it to end? This is what I am speaking of. The truth of the matter is we can continue to learn what a vast multitude of sages and scholars have to say about this quote from Genesis. One of the things which makes life interesting is just when you think you have given thought to every possible explanation, there are always those you haven't thought of, read, etc. What is even more amazing is that these diverse interpretations are all correct!Kushner is a wonderful author whose writings invite you in for a nice hot cup of tea, like an old friend, or member of the family. His writing is scholarly, and yet at the same time, warm and friendly. His light shines so brightly in this world! Buy this book, pull a blanket onto your lap on the sofa, have a nice hot cup - or 7 - of tea. Relax, enjoy, and allow yourself to be taken to a wonderful and interesting place. A place of wonder, and awe. This book not only gives one pause, but also leaves one feeling G-d's love.This was one of my favorite books!What The Torah Teaches Us About Spirituality/ Through Isaac's Own Spiritual JourneyWhat the Torah Teaches Us About SurvivalCompanion Workbook to What The Torah Teaches Us About Survival

review/text: A selection of short stories based on a science fiction theme. This book is highly recommened and it is a complete shame that it's out of print."The Giftie Gie Us" is about a post apocalyptic world where justice is won the hard way and love is even harder to find."The Dreamsender" is a story about a possible future where very special people can go into others dreams and send messages, or just talk to them. "Dreamsending" doesn't seem to have anything to do with time and space...meaning that a person can just as easily send messages across the galaxy as they can to their next door neighbor. So when a conspiracy happens on the moon and men seem to be kidnapped how do they get messages in and out of their prison?"The Energy Crisis of 2215" is about humanity needing more energy for the earth. They capture a black hole to fulfill this requirement. What they don't know is the black hole is unstable and sitting right next to the earth."Return to the Fold" is about a person that has been conditioned since birth to want to be away from other people. Not only can he not stand being in the same room as someone else, he can't stand being in a room someone else was in. This works well on space voyages lasting twenty or thirty years, but horrible when a person wants to be like everyone else. What is he to do?"The Shadows of Evening" is about humans colonizing another planet and an indigenous life form that doesn't like technology. This life form encircles anything technological and tries to get rid of any people around it. There is a special group of men that can get rid of these "shadows" and have been doing it for generations. When a new, easier way is found to rid the world of "shadows" these highly trained, highly respected Shadow Warriors are no longer needed. These men start to resent the newly trained Mindmasters."Not Always To The Strong" is the sequel to "The Shadows of Evening." In this story a rich man wants to control the newly made Mindmasters. To do this he gets the help of some of the best Shadow Warriors he can, including the main character in the last story."The Challenge" is about humanities obsession with video games and an alien race watching us from the outside."The Cassandra" is about humans that can see disasters and death in the future. Sometimes their predictions are right, usually they're not. Or so people assumed...."Dragon Pax" is about what happens to a planet after mankind has had a war that turned human civilization throughout the universe into chaos. On this planet there is a ruler called the Dragonmaster. This man has absolute power over gigantic dragons that can cause death and mayhem to anyone he desires. Does this man really want to have the kind of government he has for this country or will he make someone stand forward to help bring democracy to this world?"Job Inaction" is about a future Earth where people get jobs based on a lottery rather then work experience, or education. In this future world a man is fired because of a computer glitch and he must find a way to either get his job back or make money some other way."Teamwork" is about an alien spacecraft that lands on Earth and makes humans into slaves. A special group of people must go in and destroy the craft and save the humans aboard."The Final Report on the Lifeline Experiment" is about a psychic man that decides to find out when humans have human thought patterns. The consequences of his actions are unforeseen by him or anyone else until years in the future."Cascade Point" is about a space ship lost in time and space and what they have to do to get back to their Earth.

review/summary: Better choices for durable internally geared hubs (and for Xtracycles, too, in general)...
review/text: Below is a cut-and-paste of a review I wrote for this original version of the Nuvinci CVP internally gearedhub. I, too, built mine into a downhill-rated 36-hole rim (although with triple-butted tandem-rated spokes), and installed it on an Xtracycle cargo bike conversion. I'm reposting this review here because this item consistently comes up on the top of my Amazon searches for "Xtracycle."I don't have much of anything to add to this prologue; I pretty much couldn't have reviewed the hub without the rim built around it, and the rim I chose was more-or-less an Alex twin of the Sun Rhyno this was built with. If you want my quick take away, at the very least look to the updated'N360' (2nd generation) version of this hub. So without further ado...+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I want to start by putting my 3-star "It's OK" rating in context: This original Nuvinci CVP hub is a marvel, but it faces some stiff competition -- including its own successor (this review being written in May '11, not quite a year after the 2nd generation N360 made it to market.I've had this hub installed on an Xtracycle cargo bike for over a year, used for errand runs and transporting my toddler son around town. The installation presented a number of challenges:- The anti-torque plate had to be heavily modified (I actually constructed a new one, using the old one as a template) due to a difference in alignment of the Xtracycle's dropouts vs. the Nuvici design standard. I can't place blame, not knowing what standard exists, except to say that Nuvinci needed to provide some options for differences in frame fit.- Attaching this hub to a frame is quite complex, requiring not only the standard 15mm wrench many bolt-on hubs use, but also an 11mm and 21mm wrench for a odd-ball drive side nut. And, despite following Nuvinci's clear torque settings for this double nut, I managed to strip the threads the first time around (their customer service was wonderful and they sent a new one).- The plastic external shifter box snaps on way outside of the protection of the frame, and is awfully exposed in the event of a fall or a close swipe with a fixed object.- Shifting under load is way more difficult than it ought to be.- Gearing is woefully inadequate for a cargo bike on any kind of hills, and I was quite conscious of getting my gearing as low as allowed, anticipating this type of use.- The weight is pretty substantial, even for something entirely non-competitive such as riding to the store.On the plus side, this transmission is oh-so-smooth and dead quiet. The smoothest, quietest bike I've ever ridden short of my childhood single speed BMX bike. The 36 spoke hole option allows for a really strong wheel build. No waiting for gear changes or getting stuck inbetween gears; the continuously variable transmission lets me dial in the gearing exactly (as long as I don't have the pedals loaded too heavily).The good news is that Nuvinci addressed a lot of these complaints with their N360: the price is reduced, the weight is reduced substantially (I believe nearly 3 pounds, down to around the 6 pound range), the gear range has been *slightly* increased, shifting under load has been improved markedly, the cabling has been moved to inside the frame, and the nutty axle nut has been eliminated in favor of a more traditional setup. After spending a bit of time on the new hub at a couple of different venues, I'm confident the new N360 is clearly the way to go.In my case, I really needed increased gear range, so the newer version would have left me with about the same low gearing as the new one. Primarily for that reason, I switched instead to theRohloff Speedhub, with a bit of weight savings, and a big price increase. But if I didn't have the hills to contend with, I would have gladly replaced my original Nuvinci CVP with the current N360 model.

review/text: The average work about socialism talks about such dry topics as economics and politics. This essay doesn't do any of that. It goes into art, and even pseudo-psychology (one could say). It covers a broad variety of topics in a short amount of pages. I agree with almost everything said in this book. It's definitely worth reading and will really make you think.

review/summary: Oscar Wilde: Theory on a Holiday
review/text: Oscar Wilde's The Soul of Man under Socialism depicts the tangential and unintended callousness of socialistic thinking when it is merely theoretical and future-based and is not also activist, revolutionary and focused on the present.Wilde understands perfectly well that one of the principal goals of socialism is the elimination of poverty: "The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible." That might be the aim, but what should be done in the meantime to alleviate the suffering of the poor? In a word, the answer for Wilde is "nothing." He argues that charitable attempts to help the poor both fail to help the poor but also "prolong" the disease that cause poverty. The disease, of course, is the system of capitalistic exploitation. It is wrongheaded, Wilde argues, to use the fruits of capitalism to redress the consequences of its rampages: "It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property. It is both immoral and unfair." While Wilde is confident that the ravages of poverty will cease in a future socialistic society, he opposes all palliatives for the poor and oppressed in the meantime. That is one of the consequences of confining socialistic thought to merely theoretical and future-based considerations and failing to also make it activist, revolutionary and focused on the present.Wilde's socialism of "voluntary association" of the future is individualistic (individuals should be free to choose their own work), anti-authoritarian, and government-less (largely anarchical). In fact, Wilde sees authoritarian socialism as constituting a worse state of affairs than capitalistic exploitation: "If the Socialism is Authoritarian; if there are Governments armed with economic power as they are now with political power; if, in a word, we are to have Industrial Tyrannies, then the last state of man will be worse than the first."Wilde extols the prospects of an anti-authoritarian socialistic society because of its potential to actualize individuality. But Wilde's individualism has a kind of hierarchy about it--one, it is impossible to fail to notice, that leaves persons like himself at the top: "These are the poets, the philosophers, the men of science, the men of culture--in a word, the real men, the men who have realised themselves, and in whom all Humanity gains a partial realisation." Apparently, those given to other vocations are not quite as "real" and can only partially realize these Olympian heights.Soon Wilde's discussion of individualism acts as an unstable catalyst, causing him to veer into a wide variety of topics often inexplicably. But the topics that preoccupy him for most of the work are aesthetic and literary concerns, especially as they relate to the relationship between individualism and artistic expression. While this discussion has some merit and interest, it is difficult to imagine why these peevish considerations require the lengthy treatment they receive in a work entitled "The Soul of Man under Socialism."My reservations about Wilde's work notwithstanding, I do think this is a relatively important work to read. While the work as a whole lacks a coherence that could have made it more effective, many individual passages are keenly insightful and highly quotable.

review/summary: Very interesting, but sad.
review/text: The Soul of Man under Socialism was a very interesting little book. Although, I don't believe Oscar Wilde's interests included the common Socialist schools. Yet, socialism was the fad of the day. Many intellectuals were interested in the theories, but Oscar was in his eyes an artist and an Individualist. Capital "I" on individualist.I couldn't find a date for this writing, but I believe his legal problems and the rumors preceding his legal problems were actually the motivation, and not economics or politics.As many artists and I consider myself one, believe their work and their life are one. Oscar showed his colors as far as common people go. I could not imagine him an equal to a chimney sweep or a waiter.Oscar was hurt and he was attempting to argue that life style, and art, especially his, should be free from the common people's rules. Poetry was not controlled because nobody read poetry.I find Oscar Wild a very human elitist and although I thought it sad, I enjoyed his work immensely and this work was no different.(PS: I really appreciate Kindle books. This book was free and I received it immediately. I own at least 100 kindle books.)

review/summary: An interesting little essay
review/text: Although the title is the soul of man under socialism, the theoretical basis for what he talks about would be more of a collective anarchy commune which fosters his individualism more than the socialisms that we have seen in theory and practice in the last couple of centuries.This is an interesting little essay because of its meandering nature. it starts out as a political tract, then veers into a brief on aesthetics and then tries to synthesize the two at the end. For me, its process felt unsuccessful, but at least there are many places that can be quotable.Quotable -- to the point that I wanted to, in a half-hearted daydream, to imagine using this text as a theoretical basis to look at Wilde's own creative work to see if he meets his own aesthetic standards. While that project may not be worthwhile, the reading of this essay is worthwhile.

Socialism has been incorporated into the US and other free world governments everywhere. Like any great concept it had to be blended with its polar opposite capitalism. This was most evident in the sixties and Nixons HMO programs of the seventies. Hey it gave birth to a compromise that led to a golden age of todays unprecidented easy lifestyles. Any person would be insane to want to go back in time and live their hardships. Think about it.....

review/summary: Judy's return to the stage!
review/text: As far as I know, this is Judy Dyble's first album in a long long time. I fell in love with her voice from her work on the first Fairport Convention album, as well as the Trader Horne album she helped cut. That's about it, however. Not much since then, save for the Giles Giles and Fripp CD a couple of years ago called the Brondesbury Tapes. How thrilled I was to finally see her do something new! From the keyboard/electric bass of the first song, "Summer Gathers", the listener will hear that Judy Dyble isn't picking up where Trader Horne left off. Upon this first listen, my first thoughts were whether it would have killed her to have included a mandolin or a harpsichord on some of the songs. What can I say, I loved the Trader Horne album that much! Yet, if you, like me, have followed (or tried to) her work from her part in King Crimson with the Brondesbury Tapes, to her role on the first Fairport Convention album, to Trader Horne, you will notice here that what is present, and is the most important part of the Enchanted Garden album anyway, is Miss Dyble's voice--that never changes, thank goodness. Lyrically, the themes are also not that far off from her previous work. Many of the songs, fairytale-like and laden with mystery, evoke a world of troubadours and elves, especially on the title track. Further, a new-age sensibility seems to be imbued into many of the songs (also because of those omnipresent keyboards) whereby introspective meditations on loved ones are coupled with elements of a particular face of nature, especially snowfall and ominous sunsets.

review/summary: Great Actors - Well done film!
review/text: Shah Rukh Khan is my favorite actor. I enjoy seeing Rani Mukerji paired with him. This film was well done. It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage. One thing that stood out to me, which bothered me, was that the "in-laws" of Rani's character seemed prejudiced against Shah Rukh Khan's character. I believe that once a family member has married someone, the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new spouse. Most romantic films focus on the relationship up until marriage, with the idea that the couple will live "Happily Ever After". However, the reality is that relationships need to be cared for after marriage. And this film gives a glimpse into the reality of marriage.

review/summary: The story is overly realistic, and typical, but still a treat to watch for visual sakes
review/text: Where has it ever been wrong when Shah Rukh Khan and Rani Mukerji star together as a couple trying to work things out?They meet by accident, argue with each other for a while, start to like each other, marry, then they continue their original natural behaviors, they get complacent with each other in their marriage, and then eventually grow apart from each other. Rani Mukherji's role shows her as more serious about her career and her future, but Shah Rukh Khan's role shows him more nonchalant and maybe even a little bit lazy, and therefore, the relationship continues on a sour note.As far as the story goes, there is very little surprise here. I only really appreciate it more than many Bollywood films because, for once, I think the songs videos are more enjoyable than the movie itself.But, I generally watch Bollywood films because I love to watch good looking people on film. A good story is only secondary as my main intention is to be entertained.If you an English speaking American, and are new to Bollywood films, let me give you a breakdown of how I interpret and ingest the Bollywood experience:First of all, you will most always be reading English subtitles.The average Bollywood film is about 3 hours long.Bollywood films are very colorful. All their beautiful fashion, and colorful dance floors. In High Definition, just the sceneries alone make you appreciate what High Definition is all about.About 30 percent of the film will be music videos (with Yash Raj films, it's more like about 45 percent). I personally wish there were less music videos if the movie is already over three hours long.About 30 percent of most Bollywood films have some rather silly, really unfunny, and downright annoying comedy scenes (which is usually in the first half of the film), then the film will start to become more serious, as it moves along.One of the main reasons why you will watch a Bollywood film, is because you already chose to fall in love with one of their many beautiful actresses, or handsome actors. (I personally try to see all Rani Mukherji films, and Shah Rukh Khan is the one actor known to be one of the biggest box office sellers of Bollywood.)So, I guess I can honestly say that I have about 10 Blu-Ray Bollywood films which about 7 of them are Yash Raj releases. Though I have about 100 Bollywood films on DVD, all I really care to get on Blu-Ray now is "Lagaan" which was the first Bollywood film that I saw about 10 years ago. And perhaps "Mann" with Aamir Khan, and "Rangeela" which stars the enchanting Urmila Matondkar. Oh, and I guess it would be truly appreciated if "Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai" starring Amisha Patel and Hrithik Roshan would ever be released in High Definition Blu-Ray. The scenes in India and New Zealand were all just so beautiful on the screen.Another good movie that I would like to recommend, that is not a Yash Raj film, but is available on Blu-Ray is "Ghulam" starring Rani Mukherji and Aamir Khan. Even all the song videos in this film are all truly appreciated, and the added humor isn't so annoying. Check it out!

review/summary: My two cents.....
review/text: Having read the reviews, I'm glad I read them after I saw the movie. Had I read them before, I might never have seen this interesting little film.First, I will say that a lot of Bollywood films seem to start out funny and romantic, roping you into the characters. About half way through, they often get more dramatic, and here is where you get the meat of the story. Chalte Chalte was no different. I liked this movie. I always like SRK and RM, but especially together. They have a great chemistry. I liked that neither of the characters is flawless. People aren't. We all have sides to us that aren't particularly likeable, but it's from there that we grow. Real love is taking the good with the not so good, and the relationship in this movie was believeable. I also liked the way it ended because people don't change overnight, old habits don't just disappear, although we may want them to, even desperately so. It takes time. I felt these characters would probably tackle their issues many more times in the future, but this round made them realize that they would have to work on it if they were going to stay together and make their dreams a reality. Well done.

review/text: This is one of my favorite bollywood movies. If you're a fan of Shahrukh Khan or Rani Mukerji you'll love this movie. It's interesting too in that it goes beyond the usual pretty love story. Where a lot of movies consist of "boy meets girl, boy woos girl, boy and girl get married" this movies looks at the question of "then what?" I know some people have complained about the bickering in the second half, but I didn't think it was that excessive. The movie just portrays the usual silly arguments and misunderstandings that couples face.I'd give the movie five stars but this particular product gets only 4 stars for the DVD quality. It's definitely pixilated in parts, not the best quality picture. Still watchable, and I wouldn't return it, but wish the picture was a bit better.

review/summary: If this is going to be your first Bollywood movie...pick another!
review/text: I LOVE Bollywood movies. I saw my first "Kahbi Kushi" at a film festival and I was hooked. The love scenes were so sexy (And yet nobody even kissed! Amazing!). I loved the dancing and singing. I laughed at the silly misunderstandings. I cried (a LOT). Since then I've purchased many and loved most of them. Except this one. The first 30 minutes or so are as charming a Bollywood plot as any of the other movies. Poor boy sees rich girl, falls madly in love, follows her to another country, and woos her away from her family-approved wealthy fiance. Cute. But now there's 2 plus hours left of movie to go. And their relationship gets ugly. He can't get past her family's wealth and, though she never complains about their living situation, he's in a constant state of drama - scheming to succeed, blaming her when things don't go well...they split up, he makes a drunken scene outside her aunt's home.... Blah, blah, blah. As hammy as Shah Rukh Khan can be at times, he's never been unlikeable - until this movie. He was egotistical, arrogant, abrasive, annoying and I, frankly, wanted to reach through the screen and smack him.In short, if you want to dip your toe into the Bollywood ocean - and it's worth giving this genre a try - pick a different film.

The movie ends with some reconciliation then more bickering.Don't they learn?

That's the first 30 minutes of this movie. And if you've ever seen a Bollywood movie before, you know there's at least 2 and 1/2 hours left. So what do they fill it up with? Bickering. Mindless arguing that continues through nearly every minute of the movie. The movie was fine the first time through... though with all that fighting 3 hours seemed like 3 years.... but I'll probably never watch this one again. On my list of Great, Good, and Terrible Bollywood movies this is on the low end of Good. But it was good to see both Shah Rukh Khan and Rani again. They're wonderful!

Sure, the plot is weak at times and I'd recommend 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' or 'Diwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' over this anyday but still, it's quite entertaining. The music in the film is simply one of the best I've heard in any Indian movie, the singing...the dancing...EVERYTHING is so wonderful and will have you humming for days. The dvd also contains the music videos in separate chapters so that's a nice addition. LOVE this film and I definitely recommend it.

review/summary: No one would want a husband like this
review/text: If you enjoy music from other Bollywood movies, then there's a good chance you'll like the soundtrack of Chalte Chalte. And the scenery, whether the characters are in India or Greece, are beautiful too. I also like the main actors' other movies. However, there was no other redeeming quality to "Chalte Chalte" than what I've mentioned above.The love story is unrealistic from the beginning. That's usually okay in a romantic comedy because the characters still somehow live happily ever after, but this movie showed me that these kinds of relationships don't really work out. Okay, so this movie is realistic...but that didn't make it entertaining. The couple only got together because the man kept pressuring the woman to accept his proposal, and after they married, they bickered most of the time, mainly because of the husband's insecurities.This might be the movie for you if you're trying to watch every Shah Rukh Khan movie out there. Or if you're really bored and you could use some entertainment, even if it's just making fun of this movie, then you might want to check it out. Otherwise, please don't waste your time.

review/summary: Khaned again?
review/text: Having reviewed a few movies for Amazon.com, I thought I knew something. I DO NOT! I started watching Chalte Chalte as a critic-wanna-be, not as a viewer. Although there are some genuinely sweet and funny scenes in the first half of this film, I saw no reason to have two high-powered actors (Khan and Rani) in what initially looks like a well done but kinda milk-toast production. The first half of the film is the fantasy of falling in love and getting married. Then I got hooked. The second half is the reality of marriage and learning to live together. Where there is love there is passion and sometimes fire!Khan turns in the acting performance of a life time in the second half of the film. At one point I was so mad at his character that I wanted to slap the snot out of him. Priya (Rani) delivers the much needed slap at just the right moment. Unlike some scenes in Hindi films where combatants miss by 5 inches it really looks like Rani lets him have one (in slow-mo, not really) keeping the scene real.Rani is her usual perfect self (Who wouldn't love her?) and the supporting actors are excellent throughout the story - acting 5. Although the music and dance scenes are good and integrated well in to the film, they are not (in my opinion) big-time productions leaving the urge to watch over and over such as in movies like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Bunti Aur Babli and Dhoom 2 - so 4. The story doesn't seem that unique but it is told well so - a 3, maybe. It pains me to give this movie an overall 4 given the excellent performances of Khan, Rani and others so I give it a 5 anyway.

review/text: If there were a recipe for the perfect romantic movie, this would be it--all the right ingredients are mixed just so and the result is a feast of heady, imperfect love. Priya (played by Rani Mukerji) is upper-crust, Raj (Shahrukh Khan) is working class; she's polished, he's brash; and the two make an irresistible pair who can't resist each other, despite a mountain of obstacles. They find a way to be together, of course, and that's where most romantic movies end--but here, that's only the first half. After they wed, they come down from the high of their dramatic courtship and discover marriage isn't all wine and roses. In addition to major personality clashes--they can't stand the qualities they once loved in each other--their different social backgrounds become a growing problem, and when Raj's business runs into financial trouble and Priya tells a well-meaning lie to help him out, he stands to lose his wife and his livelihood. Mukerji and Khan--who are frequent co-stars--have never been more in sync as actors and never more convincing as lovers, whether they're making each other laugh, cry, yell, or swoon. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)

I would have loved to see a literature or concept review, such as is found in almost every other test guide on the planet.Also, it seems the PRAXIS II went from a five-response to a four-response test at some point, and the authors responded by chopping answer E off all the sample questions, without checking whether or not that was the correct answer. In other words, they revised the questions, but did not revise the answers. Most frustrating.In all, I found this book a sorry excuse for a test guide, and recommend it for nothing except mulching, or perhaps kindling.

review/text: A good short album. Mostly comprised of bonus tracks from previous releases. Entombed always picks good unique cover songs and makes them their own. Good for fans of the band, and no it isn't death metal, it doesn't sound like Wolverine Blues either, grow up people. It is a better release than Same Difference which I didn't care for except a song here or there. I do respect Entombed for trying new sounds and for releasing something on a yearly basis, unlike most bands. Pick this one up.

I recommend for the metal maniacs, entombed's new album, &quot;uprising&quot;. I have owned it for about 2 weeks and it gets better with each listen, one for the collection. Entombed are the greatest band in the whole world...Cheers!

It is, alas, out of print. I hope to find one on sale somewhere nevertheless.

review/summary: Not a very good Little Critter book
review/text: I grew up with the Litter Critter books and they always have been some of my favorite children's books. I recently got this one for my son, and I don't care for this story much at all.First off, its about mom and dad going away on a trip. However they only address that issue once, and that's on the first page when mom and dad leave and it says that grandma and grandpa are watching them. They wave goodbye.Then all the rest of it is just Little Critter messing things up or having suggestions that aren't great (such as sucking up the curtain vacuuming, knocking over a vase dusting, spilling the paint, using too much toothpaste or dish soap, wanting to buy all junk food at the store, etc.)It really feels like this is so similliar or much more suited to the Little Critter I Just Forgot book or Little Critter Visiting Grandma and Grandpa. It has very little to do with getting your child ready to be away from mom and dad should they be going on a short trip so the book fails in what it appears to be trying to do based on the title. Most other Little Critter books do a great job of telling a story that covers some kind of kid issue or fear, this one just doesn't address the issue of the title and is dissapointing.

review/text: Miss Jordan always had a special attitude for the bass, the bass lines she uses to play with singing in a group. As much as Anita O'Day used to do whith drums, Sheila Jordan has the unique ability to express herself in a clear, witty and unique way, scatting or singin words, talking and exchanging suggestions with the acoustic bass player. This is the second, according to my knowledge, and probably one of the very best of her duo recordings. A must for jazz fans and listeners keen to jazz singers with an instrumental attitude.

review/summary: Now I won't have to invest in a Leslie speaker!
review/text: No other way to put it: this thing is WONDERFUL. An ex mother-in-law gave me a cheap "synth" sometime back..."last century," and while just looking that the thing brought to mind the adjective "tacky," still, the "tones generated" by the thing were far superior to the old used Yamahas that I'd been scooping up at pawn shops. But "you get what you pay for" is a truism: while I could make cute little synth bleeps and squeaks, I couldn't get a decent "organ" sound out of any of 'em. The Dano Rocky Road Spin Speaker pedal changed all that. While my Casio STILL doesn't sound like a Hammond B3, it, at least, can "approximate" a sort of, uh, "Hammond X-Y-Or Z3" now. And, joy of joys, my guitar player and I can sit down at gigs and play Keef's leslie'd guitar riff on that Stones' Exile On Main St song, "Let It Loose" now perfectly. I love Dano products more and more every time I use any of their stuff, and I can't wait till I can save 4 bills and treat myself to a Dano Bass. But until then, I won't have to worry about investing in a "legitimate" synth, Leslie,or a Hammond now, because the Rocky Road Pedal's really done the work for me.

review/text: Got this thinking I could make my guitars sound like they were going through a Leslie. Well, eventually it does, but usually by then you are past the point where you need it. But if you learn to put it on fast ramp, and hit it just right, you too can do that wonderful Bo type wah-wah when you do the chorus on Bo Diddley. (and many other times...)Well worth the money, this is a two-fer, also being very useful with keyboards. Holding those chords a-la Steve Winwood, you can make your inexpensive Yamaha or Casio sing like a Leslie is somewhere in the room. For the money, Danelectro is the only way to go, as long as you stay away from the Cool Cat and FAB series. These food pedals and the original big metal pedals are the bee's knees!!

review/text: This was definitely worth reading! I became a fan of Christine Feehan only a few months ago and I hope she continues to write often as I have enjoyed all of her novels so far. This story was very enjoyable and interesting. I enjoyed the interaction between the two main characters and also some of the secondary characters, especially the children. It was a little predicatable, but there is still a quality in Christine Feehan's writing that grabs you and keeps you interested... and wishing that it had not ended!The only compliants I have is that one of the brothers characters was undeveloped to the point that it did not make sense, as well as the &quot;special gifts&quot; that both the main characters had. The authors seemed to imply some power beyond ESP, but yet never expanded or provided any sort of explanation for these &quot;gifts&quot;.I am really looking forward to the next novel. I hope it will be a continuation (perhaps the Don's brother?) of this story. I am also still hoping for more vampire romances as well!

review/summary: Riveting
review/text: I have really enjoyed Ms. Feehan's Dark series, so was eager to read her new book. This is a true gothic with just enough paranormal elements to help build a relationship between the hero and heroine. Nicoletta has special &quot;gifts&quot; which her entire village tries to keep a secret, however, it is the presence of these gifts which draws Don Scarletti to her. He has &quot;gifts&quot; of his own. Nicoletta isn't immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don. Unlike some authors, who use the &quot;I hate you!&quot; temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters, Ms. Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it. The love scenes are wonderful, though not very plentiful. So if you're looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books, you may be dissappointed. I read this in one sitting and couldn't put it down. The story is riveting.

review/summary: More Romance Please and Less Mystery!!
review/text: the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan's books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the &quot;dark&quot; series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!

review/summary: Not her best...........
review/text: Before I begin, let me just say that I absolutely love her Dark series. Those books are great. This one had potential, but it just fell flat. Her characters simply weren't developed enough this time for me to relate to them. This effort was decent but not at all up to her usual standards.

review/summary: Scarletti Curse (candleglow)
review/text: I would have enjoyed it more if the hero had some other powers other then being able to read minds, which by the way he's not very good at it.Or he should have been able to read the minds of who was betraying him and trying to kill him & his new bride. When the plot seems to be in trouble with no way out he can read thoughts. And only when the heroine is distressed,or in trouble. Who only questions him about his ability after she's married to him. And she keeps getting into trouble because he won't tell her anything, just keeps patting her on the head and telling her not to worry, he will protect her. Which he also doesn't do to well. The plot is long and at times boring. I hope Ms. Feehan stays with her paranormal charactars.

review/summary: disappointing read
review/text: As an avid reader of Christine Feehan, I was pretty excited when &quot;Scarletti Curse&quot; was published. Unfortunately, the novel did not live up to expectations. Unlike Feehan's earlier novels, these characters were not well-developed, and the plot was relatively shallow. There were flashes of Feehan's characteristic imagination, but over all it was a disappointing read.

review/summary: This one is missing that Feehan Spark
review/text: This book was a major disappointment. It was missing that special spark that made Ms Feehan's other novels (especially Dark Desire) something special. I found the book had very little action, little romance, and a &quot;mystery&quot; plot that was never very mysterious or suspenseful. This is definitely not a book that I will pass on to my friends and family to read.

review/text: You can read the narrative on this book so I won't get into the details, but let me just say...Wow! I have never been a reader of Christine Feehan, I picked it up at the local grocery store, went home and started to read it. I assumed like a lot of romance novel I have read, I will have to skim read until it gets into the real story. Needless to say, I was very wrong. I started to read it and in the first chapter it grabbed me and I couldn't put it down. I read it in one day (of course I got no work done) but it was well worth it. I have 5 other friends waiting for this book. You must read it. I am going to check out some of her other writings. I hope they are all that gripping.

Nicoletta was a feisty and wonderfully defiant women with a sweet and loving nature and Don Scarletti was the dark mysterious and dangerous man with a bad rep however when the two come together it makes a brilliant piece of work and I JUST LOVED IT from the beginning. You can just picture it in your mind everytime the Don arches his eyebrow at Nicoletta because of something she has done.One word for this womans work . . . . AMAZING

review/summary: Christine Feeham has done it again!
review/text: This was a great book. I have read several of Christine's Dark series so I knew that this would be a page turner and it was. This one is a gothic historical romance. It doesn't have Vampires or Carpathiansin it but the lack of those doesn't diminish this book one bit. This is the story of the village healer, a beautiful girl names Nicoletta and the Fierce, dark and cursed Don Giovanni Scarletti. Nicoletta comes to the Scarletti family home which is known by its nickname Palazzo della Morte, or in English palace of death, to help save Giovanni's young niece. She also has to treat him as he is ill also. She is strangly drawn to him even though she resists. After she returns to the village the Don envokes his right of choosing his bride from the villages on his land. She tries to hide but he finds her and makes her his bride. Together they must fight the evil that is threatening to kill them both and over come the Curse. There is many instances of humor and I found myself wanting to read more after the book was done. There are some very interesting secondary characters that I think would make good heros and heroines for possible future books. Get this book. You'll really enjoy it.

review/summary: Engaging page turner!
review/text: The Scarletti Curse is the story of a young and very innocent healer, Nicoletta, who is chosen to stand beside a powerful Don, the Don Scarletti, whom even the king feared. The story centers around the curse on the Scarletti's, where the women they love end up dead, and where most women who come to the Palazzo Scarletti die, including Nicoletta's mother and aunt. Nicoletta (a healer), herself, is chosen via bride contract by the Don Scarletti (a Telepath), and the story developed from there, with many twists and turns. The characters were well developed and the story line kept you guessing until the end. I was so hooked that I finished it in one night, the same night I got it through the mail.Christine has done it again. I picked up the &quot;Scarletti Curse&quot;, uncertain on what I would find. On one hand, she has been consistent in writing books with great character development and great story lines in her &quot;Dark&quot; series about the Carpathians. On the other, this was a non-Carpathian book, though a Gothic, so I did not know whether she could make the transition. She made the transition extremely well and created another keeper for my keeper shelf.Christine has proven that she can write differently and Scarletti Curse was refreshingly interesting. I am anticipating and hoping that she will expand this into a series. (Spoiler here: Christine has hinted that Nicoletta and Giovanni have some relation to her Carpathian series. I look forward to her exploring that in more detail)I really hope that Christine explores Antonello's character. He was a secondary character and very mysterious, the only character that Christine did not explore in depth. He quite fascinated me. I would also like to see some explanation as to where Giovanni and Antonello got their telepathic abilities.Thank you, Christine! Keep up the great work, and I hope that the publisher will release a lot more books of your books A LOT faster, as I will buy every one.

review/summary: All of the elements I like in a romance
review/text: As a fan of gothic and paranormal stories, this book appealed to me. True, it had a lot more sex than Victoria Holt or other gothic writer favorites ever included in their books, but it didn't take away from my enjoyment.Nicolette is a free spirit with a secret. She was born with the gift of healing and knowing when somebody needed her.The villagers depend on her healing skills and rally around her to keep her hid from outsiders. They know Nicolette could be burned as a witch, otherwise. Don Giovanni, the dark brooding aristocrat, wants Nicolette the first time he sees her. Though his family lives under a curse that all of their women will die, he is determined to make Nicolette his bride.I don't believe in giving too much information in a review so I won't say what happens between them. The book is very atmospheric with the castle and it's sinister wall carvings, the brothers and grandfather who have all lost their wives, and last but not least, the hero with his own gift. One thing I liked about the hero is he was arrogant, but not overly so. He had a soft, gentle side that overshadowed his arrogance, at least to me. I hate heros who are overly arrogant simply because they are men.This was my first book by this author and I am looking forward to reading Dark Prince, another book I have by her.

review/text: I became a fan of Christine's writing through her &quot;Dark&quot; series and although this ventured into different territory I was not disappointed. Christine's style and gift for writing wonderful heroes and heroines along with a fascinating story is not lost. Nicoletta is a strong, compassionate, courageous heroine that learns to make the best of a frightening and seemingly hopeless situation. She is forced into marriage with the mysterious Giovanni Scarletti, who's reputation of darkness and danger strikes fear in the hearts of most in her village. To make matters worse once married she will be forced to live in the cursed Scarletti palazzo secretly nicknamed the &quot;Palazzo Della Morte&quot; where few women who enter manage to escape with their lives. Despite her hesitation she soon discovers there is a powerful attraction between she and Giovanni and seeks to unravel the mystery surrounding her own mother's death in the castle years ago. Is Giovanni the monster her fellow villagers whispered he was or could there be much more to him than she first imagined? Giovanni is just the type of hero I enjoy, like the heroine he is one that can both frighten me yet manage to touch my heart at the same time. The story kept me on the edge of my seat. For fans of the paranormal there is that aspect as well. Nicoletta is gifted with a healing power and Giovanni has the power to speak directly into your mind. Kudos to Christine, for the many hours of enjoyment her novels provide!

review/text: Ms. Feehan has written another entertaining, and engrossing book. I got very little sleep the day I sat down to read Scarletti Curse, I didn't stop until I had read every page.Ms. Feehan's gothic bears her trademark paranormal touch. The hero, Don Giovanni Scarletti has telepathic abilities and the heroine, Nicoletta has healing abilities. While helping the Don's sick niece, Nicoletta catches the eye of the Giovanni, who decides that he wants her for his bride. Nicoletta is less than thrilled at that honor, since both her mother and aunt were killed under suspicious circumstances while employed at Palazzo Scarletti, a.k.a Palazzo della Morte (palace of death). Thus begins the tale of our fair hero and heroine. Will the Don be able to win Nicoletta`s heart? Should Nicoletta trust Giovanni? Will Nicoletta be the next victim of the Scarletti curse? What dark secret is the Scarletti family hiding? Strap up and get ready for one heck of ride as Nicoletta and Giovanni learn things that they never expected about themselves, and each other.Looking forward to reading more from this author.

review/text: Please keep in mind if you are an avid fan of Feehan, this is a different style of writing for her. I love her Dark Series and was even more impressed with her new Gothic novel. Our dark hero is made from the same mold that created her Dark Series men: powerful, dark, serious, passionate, and ofcourse possessive. We love these traits, that's why we keep coming back for more! She has created a wonderful book that includes drama, horror (as in strange things happening at the palace), and passion. I thought it was a stimulating, and thought-out plot with tense scenes that keeps you engrossed. The growing attraction and passion between the two main characters leaves you wanting to read it again. If you are fond of Gothic authors, Victoria Holt and Dorthy Eden, you will love this book. (Beware..it has alittle bit more romance and steamy scenes than our traditional authors.)

review/text: I've really like Christine Feehan Gothic stories, I have to admite that I had finish reading this book since June but haven't had the chance to write my review till now.This book is dark and mysterious which is filled with suspense and sensuality. Nicoletta is a very likable heroine with healing gift's .She embrace life with such open arms and feet ( you'll understand once you read it). Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery which makes you want to know him and his family even more. The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.Christine Feehan has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo, including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story, there were some parts that dragged a bit but I guess she wanted the readers to have a good visual through out the read.

review/summary: Absolutely Wonderful!
review/text: Having read Feehan's &quot;Dark&quot; series, I have to say that I think this is her best book ever. THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a true gothic romance, and people who love gothics--like me--will definitely want to read it.The book has elements that were in Feehan's vampire novels and which will be familiar to that audience: telepathy; a dictatorial hero (the curse of the Scarlettis is that they're supposedly destined to kill the women they love in jealous rages); the heroine with REALLY long hair; destiny. There's also the quintessential gothic palace--poetically called the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; by the local villagers--with hideous artwork, secret passageways, etc., etc., whose inhabitants all seem to be up to something nefarious.I quickly became completely engrossed in the story. No, it's not terribly original, but I loved every turn in the plot, anyway. The story is told very much from the heroine's point of view, which is appropriate, and all the other characters were well filled-out and suited for their purpose in the book. The reason I'm giving THE SCARLETTI CURSE four stars instead of five, however, is that the book, while enjoyable, did have some problems. For example, the love scenes seemed emotionless and out of place in the novel, which was odd because Feehan usually excells at love scenes. I also thought the explanation for everything happening at the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; didn't quite make sense.Despite these two things, however, I thoroughly enjoyed THE SCARLETTI CURSE, and I think Christine Feehan has found her niche! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the work of Ann Radcliffe, Mary Stewart, the Brontes, or even Lisa Jane Smith. Definitely, a good read.

review/summary: Brimming with mystery and . . . danger
review/text: I must confess that I was very leery to begin reading this book. My feelings have nothing to do with Ms. Feehan's writing style. I so love Christine's Dark series, I feared that I would inevitably begin to make comparisons and would find this book a major disappointment. It wasn't.There is a terrible curse which plagues the Scarletti men. Every woman who enters the Palazzo as a bride winds up dead. What or . . . whom is causing these fatal accidents?Nicoletta is a healer who possesses &quot;special&quot; gifts. Deep within her being she senses when someone needs her.

review/summary: Has enough mystery to keep you reading
review/text: For many years, the Scarletti family history has been shrouded in curses and dark mysteries. Whispers of evil, murder and insanity have been going around the villagers about the family that rules their lands. They say that no bride has ever survived in the palazzo, and considering the number of women who have met their untimely death in what everyone has come to refer to as the Palazzo Della Morte (Palace of Death), it seemed that the curse is true.Unbeknown to the villagers, the current don has set his eyes on their healer, Nicoletta, the woman whose identity they have protected for fear that she will be branded a witch by those who might misinterpret her gift of healing. So how did Don Giovanni Scarletti find out about their beloved Nicoletta when no one has spoken of her to outsiders? Could the rumor be true then that he has powers because he is in league with the devil?THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a dark and mysterious novel filled with suspense and sensuality. Nicoletta is a very likable heroine, with her wit and exuberance. I loved the way she seemed to embrace life with such open arms. Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery. The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.I must say though that even though the author has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo, including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story, there were some parts that dragged a bit. I also didn't care much about the political intrigue, and thought that it wasn't blended in well with the story. I might have understood it more had the author bothered to actually tell us which date the story was meant to have happened (I'm only guessing 15th or 16th century). I know this seems trivial, but when I'm reading a historical novel, I do like to know what period it's supposed to be.Overall, this wasn't a bad book. I did enjoy the banter between the don and his barefoot bride. You can read about Giovanni and Nicoletta's descendant, Antonietta Scarletti, in Dark Symphony (which I'm reading at the moment).

review/text: This was a great book! But the dialogue between Nicoletta and her guardian just seem to drag on forever! I missed the intense dialogue that Feehan usually devotes to the two leads. It seemed that they had very little interaction except for the last 1/4 of the book. Why such devotion to this mother-daughter relationship when it didn't seem to lead to anything crucial within the story? It really detracted from the couple's story. Other than that, the two leads were great and I agree with previous entrys - PLEASE write a book on the other brothers.

review/summary: Ick ack. Put it back.
review/text: I absolutely couldn't stand this book!I'm not understanding how it's sexy for a woman to give up her friends and life for a guy who wishes to control her completely. The Don was a jerk. Nicoletta is an awesome heroine in the beginning, but turns into a submissive wifey thing by the end. It's a sad thing when a woman, to paraphrase an actually part of Nicoletta's thoughts, "leaves her old life behind because he'll never like it, and because she just HAS to". Eeeeew.I loved the Dark series, and constantly used to stalk the bookstore waiting for the next one. This one was the beginning of the end of my love for Ms. Feehan's work. I bought it to tide me over from one Dark book to the next, and it made me so angry that I wrote the author and got into a big argument over the book!Please, please, please...read something in the Dark series, or Emma Holly's Upyr series. You'll be a lot happier.

review/text: I first found Christine Feehan's work through 'Dark Prince'. It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series! I thought this book would be the same - not even close. The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum. Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional. I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place. In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series. Please Christine don't write any more like this.

review/summary: This book was so-so.
review/text: At first it was interesting because the character Nicoletta was a free spirit who vowed never to be married to anyone who would subject her to abuse or become servile to. It was when she met Don Giovanni Scarletti, she sensed something evil about him and his family. Don Scarletti had possession of her mind, body, and soul. His dark features were erotic, yet frightening to Nicoletta. However, I have found myself getting a little bored with the book. It seems as if something that is bound to happen, doesn't happen. It's a good read, but unfortunately I am getting restless and impatient with the Scarletti curse and the passionate fires between Nicoletta and Don Giovanni.

review/summary: Beautiful & Touching
review/text: I really love The Scarletti Curse, having reread it for more than 5 times I believe.The pacing is good, with enough action, excitement and unconditional love (a necessity to destroy the evil curse at work).The book starts with village girl Nicoletta being summoned to accompany the village "healer" Maria Pia, who raised Nicoletta since her mother's death, to the Scarletti Palazzo. They keep this charade to prevent the people at the palazzo knowing about Nicoletta's extraordinary healing powers (this heritage is explained in the Carpathian book "Dark Symphony, in which the lifemate is a descendant of the main characters/couple). As Maria Pia is a midwife herself this causes no problem.At the palazzo the patients turned out to be Don Giovanni Scarletti and his niece Sofia, suffering from food poisoning. While both "healer" and assistant do their work, Don Scarletti keeps observing Nicoletta, asking her questions when Maria Pia fell asleep and after many dissatisfying non-answers says "I am not so blind as you and the healer seem to think"!A few days later the "healer" and assistant were summoned to the palazzo again, but this time Nicoletta knows that no one is ill. Maria Pia therefore went back to the Palazzo with another assistant, but this assistant is old and when asked about Nicoletta kept telling the Don how wonderful and extraordinary she really is. This gives Don Giovanni a reason to choose a bride at The Bridal Convent. His choice is Nicoletta, who gets escorted (begging and struggling) back to the palazzo by the Don.In the following days up to and after the wedding arguments heat up, a few murders commited, the staff gossip, while Nicoletta grows into the role of the Lady of the Palazzo.

review/text: What an excellent book. Great use of characters and character growth. The chracters are revealed slowly in layers. Multidimensional supporting characters. There are a pair of young girls that are so well created you can hear the russle of their gowns and the patter of their feet running down the palazzo's corridors. A mystery that grows slowly throughout the book. Wonderful sense of the time and place. I have cried 3 times while reading this book.The level of mystery and intrigue reminds me of her Ghostwalker series which has the same depth of conspiracy interwoven into the romance.This is certainly one of Christine Feehan's defining works.

review/text: This book was a bit different for me perhaps because of its historical setting. It started out well, but i soon tired of the Italien phrases, such as &quot;mia madre&quot; and &quot;mia zia&quot; That got really annoying. Also, the Hero was very violent and cagey at first then suddenly got tender and mushy towards the end. It was disconcerting. Ms. Feehan seems to have a preference for characters with dark hair and eyes. I need a little more variety, please! Ms. Feehan also writes her main female characters to fight desperately for their independence throughtout the book, knowing that they will not end against their brooding, possessive Hero. I get tired of the constant whining and carrying on. But it seems that the females also go through some magical personality transformation after the first sex scene. I know sex is good, but come on. Overall, I liked the story even it did bog down in a few places, and i hated the main female's name, Nicoletta. reminds of all those stop-cigarette-smoking commercials.

review/text: I started this book with great expectations after reading all the dark series but found it not as compelling as them to start with. It took me a while to get into the book. The story is slow to start with, but it develops into a very exciting climax. I never guessed the culprit and it was a complete surprise to me. I think I have been spoiled for anything else by the Dark Series and it will take a lot to compete with them. I would have given this book 5 stars if it hadn't been for the beginning.

review/summary: Sure Miss
review/text: I have loved all of Christine Feehans &quot;Dark&quot; novels. I was looking forward to the Scarleti novel as well. I was suprised at her change of writting style. I kept thinking I was reading a Ann Rice wanta be. The characters are now well drawn, Nicolette is weak, scared and is not consitant with her personality. We do not get to know what makes Giovanni &quot;tick&quot; he is not well drawn and what motivates him. Feehan spent so much time trying to make the castle a dark scarry place that it was overkill. Nicolette the villiage healer is picked as the bride for the local and powerful Don Giovanni,who is cursed, after she heals his neice. He persues her and seems to speak to her with special powers that scare her, even though she has her own special healing powers. Nicolette goes from being a superstitious weak scardy cat, to not caring at all and doing as she pleases. Giovanni pushes the wedding ahead, not wanting to wait to take her. He goes from extremely controlling to being very caring and gentle. Giovanni does not care that he takes her from what she loves, or what is important to Nicolette as long as she does what he tells her to do. Nicolette finally figures out that the family &quot;curse&quot; for the Scarlettis is from a family member and frees Giovanni from the curse. I do not recommend the book, it was a disappointment to me. The writter spent to much time using words to describe the landscape and the buildings and the rooms and I don't remember what all else, and she did not develope her characters.

review/summary: Feehan never misses
review/text: If you're a fan of Christine Feehan, you already know some of the elements you'll find in this book - beautiful, courageous, spirited heroine and strong, intelligent, handsome, tortured hero. Christine Feehan has put these elements in play in such exciting ways in her Dark series that she's raised the bar incredibly for Paranormal romance. It's hard to picture anyone writing about noble vampire-like creatures in a more exciting, sensuous, just flat out stunning way. This book, though not about the vampire-like beings in her others, adds an exciting Gothic twist to Christine's writing, and a clever mystery to her incredibly involving characterizations. The suspenseful ending is very exciting, and the reader is not sure until the end how the book will resolve. I particularly loved Nicoletta's free-spirited, naturalist perspective; her grounded innocence makes such a compelling counterpoint to Don Scarletti's cursed magnificence. I own every Christine Feehan book and recommend them ALL. This is a fitting addition to her wonderful writing.

review/summary: Good Book, But Could off Been Better
review/text: The book was good up until the end, when I found out who the killer was. I was expecting more. Towards the end of the book finding the real killer killed it for me. To me towards the end the story started loosing itself. I guess the way the ending was written, letting one know who the killer is, was not done properly. One is kept in suspense through out the whole story, and then she just trows you who the killer is out of nowhere and in a rush. Her best work is the Dark series books. I cannot wait for DARK DESIRE.

review/summary: Scarletti Curse
review/text: I enjoy Ms Feehan's general writing style, and loved every one of the Dark Series books...but this gothic started very slow. For over a hundred pages, I still felt like the background was still being set and the real story hadn't begun. Finally, she gets to the gothic mansion and I felt that THAT is when the story began. Once at this point, the plot seems to take up some speed and has a lot of suspense and gothic darkness. Although some questions are answered, I felt like she could have taken some of the characters a bit further. I also felt like some of the scenes were startlingly switched, for the suspense, and I had to go back and re-read a page again to figure out what was going on. I wouldn't re-read this again, but would still probably want to try her next gothic to see how that one goes.

review/summary: Wonderful!!!
review/text: Wonderful book! Very few fans of Feehan's Dark series seem to realize that although this book is not part of the Dark series, is the children and children's children of this couple will tie in to the Dark series later. Bryon's lifemate will come from this line. But if you want to learn about what's going to happen in the future books in this series as well as the Dark series, then go to Feehan's web page. You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story, Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions! I'll sell you on these books!

review/summary: Fabulous Book! Fabulous Author!!
review/text: I'm not usually a gothic fan, but I LOVE Christine Feehan's books, so I grabbed this one and took a chance(I did the same back when I picked up Ms. Feehan's first &quot;Dark&quot; book, never having been a vampire fan,and those books have become my all-time favorite Keepers). Once again this incredible author did not dissapoint. I was riveted from page one! This is an author that not only yanks you into the story with a fascinating plot and incredibly descriptive detail (I actually got chills and the hair on my arms raised while I walked through the Palazzo with Nicolletta), but her characters become a part of you. Her characters are so real I truly found myself loving them. Not just finding them interesting, amusing, wonderful and touching, but really caring about them, as though they were actual people, a part of my life. Ms. Feehan weaves such a powerful spell sometimes I have to remind myself it's not real. Her books are THAT GOOD!!!The only drawback, of course, is the usual one, waiting impatiently for this author's next book to come out! I highly recomend The Scarletti Curse, as well as ALL of Christine Feehan's previous books. YOU ARE IN FOR A REAL TREAT!

review/summary: Different but still great
review/text: Though I still favor the carpathian series I really enjoyed this book. Christine Feehan still kept some of her supernatural writing which made this book stand out from others that write mystery romance. Her men are still wonderfully stubborn, know what they want and get it. Her women in her stories are still head strong, not whiny and give the men a challenge. I recommend this book to anyone , I finished it in 2 days. Now lets get back to the carpathian series, this only wets your appetite for more Christine Feehan books!!!!

review/summary: I really wish i hadn't wasted my time
review/text: First, let me say, I'd heard that I might find the Dark Series of Christine Feehan's my cup of tea and for some unknown reason, thought this was one in the series - no need to tell you, I was severely disappointed (and confused).This book really reminded me of the romances my Mother used to read back in the 70's - blech! Lots of dark male broodiness, all written from the heroines point of view, and of course she's a young innocent virgin._____________edited to add: I really wish I had only given this one star, but it appears I can't change that now.

review/summary: A Lost Author
review/text: I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date, except one. I very much enjoyed them at first, but nothing EVER gets resolved. You would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced. As for this book, it is an off-shoot of another Carpathian novel about the Jaguar Line. I was hoping to find out more about this curse, the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent. Her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive. I will NOT be buying any further books by this author. What a shame.

review/summary: Outstanding!
review/text: A fabulous and sexy read! Don Giovanni Scarletti is determined to have beautiful Nicoletta, the village healer, as his bride. He wanted her from the moment he saw her, despite her efforts to disguise her beauty. She went to his house to treat his niece who was poisoned and she ends up treating him as well since he too was poisoned. Problem with wanting to marry her is, all the women his family has chosen for their brides ends up dead. But he is not going to let that stop him from getting Nicoletta. Their story was beautiful and romantic and was a great pleasure to read. This book had just the right balance of mystery, horror and passion. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Favorate book
review/text: I have read almost all of Ms. Feehan's books, but I think this has become one of my favorites. I was kind of hesitant to buy it because it wasn't part of the Dark Series, and I wasn't sure I'd like it. Once I saw the price though, I decided to take a chance. After reading the first chapter, I knew my worries were TOTALLY unfounded. I was hooked! And to my surprise, the story is about an ancestor of Antonietta Scarletti (the female lead of "Dark Symphony"). I could NOT put it down! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys romance novels, or anyone who likes a good read.

review/text: What a read! I loved it. The romance was hot but it wasnt just that. Feehan creates a world that you believe and all the characters are well written. There was no author intrusion in any of the pages and the curse plot works really well as it turns out to be something you dont expect at all. All Feehan lovers will enjoy this as its Feehan at her best. Dont be sad that there arent any Carthapians in it, the story really doesnt need any!
